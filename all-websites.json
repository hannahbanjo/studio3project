    "cleaned_text":"Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu\nRemarks at the Women in Housing and Finance Public Policy Luncheon\n\u201cThe Fraud Challenge\u201d\nDecember 11, 2024\nThe increasing prevalence of financial fraud presents a special challenge for us as a\nsociety. While fraud does not have the profile of Basel 3 or cyber risk, its everyday impact in\npeople\u2019s daily lives warrants attention. Fraud not only harms consumers, but also leads to distrust\nin others, in institutions, and in the financial system. Effectively addressing this challenge is\ngoing to require all stakeholders\u2014from banks to social media platforms\u2014to each pull their\nweight and to act above and beyond what is currently legally required.\nThe situation reminds me of trash left on the street. I live in the city. Technically, litter\nthat is not on my property is not my concern. I have no obligation to pick it up. Neither do my\nneighbors. And yet if no one picks up the errant bits of litter when they walk by, then more litter\ntends to appear. Passersby feel it is OK to drop their wrapper on the ground or leave their empty\ncup on the sidewalk when others have done so. Each act of littering and walking by litter is\nrelatively small. But the cumulative effect is palpable. The neighborhood becomes less nice, less\ninviting, less orderly, less valued, and can even feel less safe. Over time, if left unaddressed, the\nsituation becomes accepted as normal.\nThe steady rise and pervasiveness of fraud today presents each stakeholder, including\nregulators, with a choice. If everyone does only the minimum of what is legally required of them, consumers will continue to be harmed, people\u2019s distrust in each other and in institutions will\ncontinue to rise, and elevated levels of fraud will become normalized.\nThe most efficient and effective way to avoid this outcome would be for each and every\nstakeholder to step up and do their part to combat fraud. This would mean getting in the habit of\nleaning down and picking up the proverbial trash instead of just walking by it, even if doing so\nisn\u2019t legally required.\nFortunately, the banks I\u2019ve spoken to about addressing fraud are open to this; many have\nalready begun to act.\nFirst, I should note the importance of complying with existing laws and regulations to\npromptly identify, investigate, and resolve fraud concerns, such as under the Expedited Funds\nAvailability Act (Regulation CC), and to address potentially unfair practices prohibited under\nSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 1031 of the Dodd\u2013Frank Act. When\nconsumers fall victim to fraud or scams, they should have confidence that their bank will comply\nwith applicable laws when researching potentially fraudulent check, debit, and credit card\ntransactions, including the provisional credit requirements of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act\n(Regulation E) and the billing error requirements of the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z).\nSecond, we\u2019ve seen many banks increase their individual efforts to address fraud. These\nefforts include providing bank customers with relevant information about trending scams and\nhow to avoid them and improving or tightening fraud detection and monitoring systems to\nidentify potential frauds in a timely manner. I have heard countless stories of bank branch\nemployees going the extra mile to educate customers about the risks of wiring all their funds to a\nsuspicious account.\n2 Third, several bank trade groups have formed fraud task forces to collaborate and share\ninformation. For example, the American Bankers Association (ABA) has created a check fraud\nclaim directory,1 which is intended to help banks needing to file a check warranty breach claim\nwith another financial institution. The Independent Community Bankers of America formed a\ncheck fraud task force of banks and state bankers\u2019 associations and leads a financial sector fraud\nworking group.2 And Early Warning System (EWS), which operates the bank-owned Zelle\nnetwork and was recently cited by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for\nvarious weaknesses,3 has taken steps to further strengthen its fraud detection program.\nWhile these and other initiatives are promising and more needs to be done, banks and\nindustry trade groups cannot effectively address fraud all by themselves. Take, for instance,\ncheck fraud. The recent rise in check fraud can be traced in large part to bad actors intercepting\nchecks sent through the U.S. Post Office. To combat this, the ABA and the U.S. Postal\nInspection Service announced a joint effort to combat check fraud in March 2024.4 The joint\ninitiative focuses on educating U.S. Postal Service and bank customers, addressing money mules\nand collusive accountholders, collaborating with law enforcement, and training bank employees\nand postal workers on red flags and prevention.\n1 American Bankers Association, \u201cABA Fraud Contact Directory.\u201d\n2 Independent Community Bankers of America, \u201cCommunity Banks Are Fighting Check Fraud on the Front Lines,\u201d\nMarch 20, 2024.\n3 See U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Majority Staff Report, A Fast and Easy Way to Lose\nMoney: Insufficient Consumer Protection on the Zelle Network, July 23, 2024; U.S. Senate, Committee on\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \u201cAn Oversight Hearing to Examine How Zelle and the Big Banks\nFail to Protect Consumers From Fraud,\u201d July 23, 2024.\n4 American Bankers Association, \u201cABA and U.S. Postal Inspection Service Announce Partnership to Combat Check\nFraud,\u201d March 19, 2024.\n3 Similarly, a significant amount of fraud on peer-to-peer payment platforms originates\nfrom users responding to unsolicited text messages, emails, and social media posts.5 In the\nUnited Kingdom, where liability for such fraud has been assigned to banks, several banking\norganizations have established a partnership with Meta, the owner of Facebook, to share\ninformation via a Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange. While relatively new, reports indicate\nthat in an early pilot, Meta removed 20,000 scam accounts based on the collaboration.6\nIn a sign that fraud may be becoming normalized, so-called first party fraud is also on the\nrise. Take, for instance, the recent check-kiting social media posts regarding JPMorgan ATMs\nthat went viral on TikTok. A temporary technical glitch let customers deposit large checks in\nATMs and withdraw funds immediately before the checks could clear. Recent media reports\nnoted that the bank is investigating thousands of possible check fraud incidents related to this\nATM glitch.7\nA laissez-faire view of this might conclude that as long as no laws or regulations are\nbeing violated, elevated levels of fraud may simply be the new normal, the cost of innovation\n5 Federal Trade Commission, \u201cWho Experiences Scams? A Story for All Ages,\u201d December 8, 2022. For instance,\naccording to data from the Federal Trade Commission, in 2021 social media was the single biggest starting point for\nscams against Americans ages 18\u201359; 31 percent of people in that age range who reported losing money to a scam\nsaid that the scheme started on social media. For those ages 18\u201329, nearly 40 percent of those who reported losing\nmoney to a scam said the scam originated on social media. Among adults 60 years or older, that percentage was 15\npercent. See also Payment Systems Regulator Ltd., Authorised Push Payment (APP) Scams Performance Report,\nJuly 2024.\n6 PYMNTS, \u201cMeta Teams With UK Banks to Fight Scammers,\u201d October 2, 2024.\n7 For example, Payments Dive, \u201cViral JPMorgan Chase Glitch Is \u2018Fraud, Plain and Simple,\u2019 Bank Says,\u201d September\n4, 2024; Reuters, \u201cJPMorgan Sues Customers Over Check Fraud Linked to Glitch That Went Viral,\u201d October 28,\n2024.\n4 and technological advancement. I believe this underestimates the cumulative sense of disorder\nand distrust that can emanate from seemingly small but repeated acts of fraud.8\nAs with many collective action problems, public-private partnerships can be effective.\nFor instance, coordination and information-sharing efforts focused on cyber risks provide a\nuseful model for consideration. At the OCC, we are focused on supporting and encouraging these\nand other collaborative fraud education and fraud prevention efforts. In addition, we are\nregularly engaging with our partners in interagency and international efforts to strengthen\nregulatory and supervisory responses to financial fraud. This includes participating in various\nworking groups with representatives from industry, financial regulators, and law enforcement.\nBanks and bank regulators can and will need to do more to address fraud. But they cannot\nsolve the problem on their own. Social media platforms, telecommunication companies, email\nhosts, the U.S. Postal Service, and law enforcement need to step up and do their part as well to\nkeep the proverbial streets clean, safe, and trusted. The OCC looks forward to continued and\nenhanced collaboration with all stakeholders to address this important issue.\n8 See The Ezra Klein Show, \u201cThe Hidden Politics of Disorder,\u201d, Apple Podcasts, October 18, 2024.\n5",

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-53 | June 16, 2025 Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Comment to Address Payments and Check Fraud Share This Page: Joint Release Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Reserve Board Office of the Comptroller of the Currency The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced a request for comment on potential actions to help consumers, businesses, and financial institutions mitigate risk of payments fraud, with a particular focus on check fraud. For purposes of the request for information, payments fraud generally refers to the use of illegal means to make or receive payments for personal gain, including scams. Because payments fraud may involve multiple institutions and payment methods, no single agency or private-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. Therefore, the agencies are seeking public comment on discrete actions, collectively or independently, to mitigate payments fraud, including check fraud, within their respective bank regulation and payments authorities. Input is requested on five potential areas for improvement and collaboration: External collaboration among the agencies, Federal Reserve Banks, and industry stakeholders; Consumer, business, and industry education by the agencies and Federal Reserve Banks to educate about payments fraud; Regulation and supervision to mitigate payments fraud, including opportunities the Board may have related to check fraud; Payments fraud data collection and information sharing; and Federal Reserve Banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 operator tools and services to reduce payments fraud. In addition to seeking public input, the agencies will also continue looking for additional opportunities to effectively collaborate across other state and federal agencies given the importance of interagency coordination to help mitigate payments fraud. Comments must be received within 90 days after date of publication in the Federal Register.

Introduction\nPayments fraud inflicts significant harm on consumers, businesses, and financial\ninstitutions. Payments fraud also has the potential to erode public trust in\u2014and\nundermine the safety, accessibility, and efficiency of\u2014the nation\u2019s payments system,\nupon which the U.S. financial system depends. As part of their objectives to promote the\nsafety of the U.S. financial system, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC have overlapping but also\ndiscrete roles and authorities related to the issue of payments fraud. For example, the\nBoard, FDIC, and OCC all engage in supervision of financial institutions. In addition to\nsupervising financial institutions, the FDIC has the distinct mission to maintain stability\nand public confidence in the nation\u2019s financial system as the insurer of bank deposits.\nThe FRS, which includes the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks), also\nfocuses on payment system safety as a payment system operator and catalyst for payment\nsystem improvements. Therefore, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC are each interested in\nexploring ways to help mitigate risk of payments fraud. Given that the FRS, FDIC, and\nOCC have specific differing roles and authorities, this mitigation could take the form of\ncollective action where roles align, such as joint supervisory guidance, or independent\n7 of 22 action where roles differ, such as changes to the payment systems operated by the\nReserve Banks.\nII. Background\nWhile there is no consensus on the definition of \u201cpayments fraud,\u201d for purposes of\nthis RFI, \u201cpayments fraud\u201d generally refers to the use of illegal means, including\nintentional deception, misrepresentation, or manipulation, to make or receive payments\nfor personal gain.1 The term \u201cpayments fraud\u201d also includes scams, a subset of fraud.2\nMany sources indicate that payments fraud is growing. For example, according to\ndata from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), losses reported for noncard payments\nfraud increased 271 percent between 2020 and 2024.3 Data from the U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) show that the number\nof Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed related to check, ACH, and wire fraud have\nincreased 489 percent between 2014 and 2024.4\n1 See U.S. Government Accountability Office, Improper Payments and Fraud: How They Are Related but\nDifferent (Dec. 7, 2023), https:\/\/www.gao.gov\/assets\/d24106608.pdf and U.S. Department of Justice,\nBureau of Justice Statistics, Financial Fraud, https:\/\/bjs.ojp.gov\/taxonomy\/term\/financial-fraud.\n2 See Federal Reserve, FedPayments Improvement, Defined Scams to Fight Scams,\nhttps:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org\/news\/blog\/defined-scams-to-fight-scams.\n3 See FTC Consumer Sentinel Network Fraud Reports, All Fraud Reports by Payment Method,\nhttps:\/\/public.tableau.com\/app\/profile\/federal.trade.commission\/viz\/FraudReports\/FraudFacts (\u201cPayment\n& Contact Methods\u201d tab). Specifically, these figures indicate that fraud reports for payments apps or\nservices, bank transfers or payments, wire transfers, and checks have increased from 145,358 in 2020,\nresulting in a loss of $806 million, to more than 188,000 in 2024, resulting in a loss of $2.99 billion.\n4 Compare FinCEN, SAR Filings by Industry \u2013 Depository Institution, https:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/reports\/sar-\nstats\/sar-filings-industry (Exhibit 5: Number of Filings by Type of Suspicious Activity from Depository\nInstitution Industry, 2024 data) with FinCEN, Suspicious Activity Report Statistics (SAR Stats),\nhttps:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/reports\/sar-stats (Industry Type: Depository Institution, Year & Month: 2024 (all\nmonths), Suspicious Activity Category\/Type: Fraud > ACH, Check, Wire).\n8 of 22 The rise in check fraud is particularly notable. Numerous sources report\nincreasing levels of check fraud in recent years, despite overall decreases in check usage.5\nChecks can be stolen, altered, or forged. For instance, the physical nature of paper\nchecks makes them susceptible to theft while in transit or when left in unsecured\nlocations. Products and services to detect altered or forged checks during the clearing\nprocess have varying degrees of effectiveness given that checks do not inherently include\nexplicit security features. Checks also contain sensitive information\u2014including the\npayor\u2019s name, account number, routing number, address, and signature\u2014that can be used\nby criminals to conduct other forms of payments fraud.\nA payments fraud scheme may involve multiple institutions and payment\nmethods, each of which may fall within the remit of different Federal and State agencies.\nAs a result, and given the scope and complexity of payments fraud schemes, no agency or\nprivate-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. The Board, FDIC, and OCC\nnonetheless may be able to take certain discrete steps, collectively or independently, to\nmitigate payments fraud through their various roles discussed further below, such as\nregulator and supervisor. In addition, Reserve Banks may be able to further support the\nindustry in addressing fraud as payments system operator and payments improvement\ncatalyst.\nTherefore, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC are considering whether additional actions\nmay be warranted, collectively or independently in their different roles. Given the\n5 For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury reports that check fraud in the United States has risen\n385 percent since the COVID-19 pandemic. See Department of the Treasury, Treasury Announces\nEnhanced Fraud Detection Process Using AI Recovers $375M in Fiscal Year 2023 (Feb. 28, 2024),\nhttps:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy2134. FinCEN reports that check fraud accounted for\napproximately 30 percent of fraud-related SARs filed in 2023. See SAR Stats,\nhttps:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/reports\/sar-stats.\n9 of 22 complexity and scope of payments fraud, input and engagement from a variety of\nstakeholders will be helpful to identify and evaluate the range of potential actions to\nconsider.\nIII. Request for Information\nAs explained below, comment is requested on five potential areas for\nimprovement and collaboration that could help mitigate payments fraud:\n\uf0b7 External collaboration (questions 1\u20134)\n\uf0b7 Consumer, business, and industry education (questions 5\u20138)\n\uf0b7 Regulation and supervision (questions 9\u201315)\n\uf0b7 Payments fraud data collection and information sharing (questions 16\u201320)\n\uf0b7 Reserve Banks\u2019 operator tools and services (questions 21\u201322)\nCommenters are also invited to provide perspectives related to payments fraud more\ngenerally (questions 23-26).\nWhere comments apply to only a subset of the FRS, FDIC, and OCC, please\nidentify the relevant entity or entities.\nExternal Collaboration\nThe FRS, FDIC, and OCC collaborate with stakeholders in various ways to\nsupport the safety and efficiency of the U.S. financial system. For example, the Board,\nFDIC, and OCC, together with other Federal and State agencies, issued guidance on elder\nfinancial exploitation.6 More recently, the Reserve Banks collaborated with various\n6 See Interagency Statement on Elder Financial Exploitation (Dec. 4, 2024),\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/pressreleases\/bcreg20241204a.htm;\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/system\/files\/2024-12\/interagency-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation.pdf; and\nhttps:\/\/www.occ.gov\/news-issuances\/bulletins\/2024\/bulletin-2024-34.html.\n10 of 22 industry stakeholders to launch the FraudClassifierSM model in 2020 and\nScamClassifierSM model in 2024 to help address the industry-wide challenge of\ninconsistent classifications for payments fraud.7 Additionally, the FRS in its role as\npayment system improvement catalyst worked with the payments and banking industry\nand other stakeholders to develop strategies for improving the U.S. payments system,\nwhich resulted in the introduction of instant payments in the United States.8 There may\nbe opportunities to facilitate further collaboration among industry stakeholders to better\naddress payments fraud. Commenters are invited to respond to the following questions:\n1. What actions could increase collaboration among stakeholders to address\npayments fraud?\n2. What types of collaboration, including standard setting, could be most effective in\naddressing payments fraud? What are some of the biggest obstacles to these types\nof collaboration?\n3. Which organizations outside of the payments or banking industry might provide\nadditional insights related to payments fraud and be effective collaborators in\ndetecting, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?\n4. Could increased collaboration among Federal and State agencies help detect,\nprevent, and mitigate payments fraud? If so, how?\n7 See https:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org\/strategic-initiatives\/payments-security\/fraudclassifier-model\/\nand https:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org\/strategic-initiatives\/payments-security\/scams\/scamclassifier-\nmodel\/.\n8 See Federal Reserve System, Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System (Jan. 26, 2015),\nhttps:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/strategies-improving-us-payment-system.pdf.\n11 of 22 Consumer, Business, and Industry Education\nConsumers, businesses, financial institutions, and other industry stakeholders\ncurrently have access to education on a range of financial topics, including payments\nfraud.9 However, there may be a need for further education specific to payments fraud.\nEffective payments fraud education could, for example, help industry stakeholders\nidentify suspected payments fraud and better inform affected parties about what steps to\ntake following an incident of payments fraud. The effectiveness of any payments fraud\neducation, however, may be undermined by the ever-evolving nature of payments fraud,\nthe highly specific and sensitive nature of these crimes, and the range of potentially\ninconsistent guidance from multiple sources.\nTo assist in developing potential new payments fraud education, commenters are\ninvited to respond to the following questions:\n5. In general, what types of payments fraud education are most effective, and why?\nWould different audiences (for example, industry and consumers) benefit from\ndifferent types of payments fraud education?\n6. Would additional education informing consumers and businesses about safe\npayment practices be helpful to reduce payments fraud and promote access to\nsafe, secure payment options?\n9 For example, the OCC recently launched \u201cSafe Money,\u201d a series of informational facts sheets to help\nconsumers recognize and avoid common financial frauds and scams at https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/publications-\nand-resources\/publications\/safe-money\/index-safe-money.html. The Federal Reserve offers consumer\nadvice and educational resources on its website at\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/consumerscommunities\/fraud-scams.htm and through each Reserve Bank\u2019s\nwebsite. The Federal Reserve also provides consumer alerts, an avenue for consumer complaints, and other\nrelevant resources on payments fraud at https:\/\/www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov. The FDIC provides\nperiodic newsletters to consumers, providing practical guidance on how to become a smarter, safer user of\nfinancial services, including helpful hints, quick tips, and common-sense strategies to protect and stretch\nyour hard-earned dollars. This includes topics such as scammers, fake banks, or fraud against the elderly.\nSee https:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/consumer-resource-center\/fdic-consumer-news for more information.\n12 of 22 7. Which approaches could make existing payments fraud education more effective?\nFor example, would targeting outreach to particular audiences or conducting\nadditional education in collaboration with other key stakeholders be effective?\n8. Are current online resources effective in providing education on payments fraud?\nIf not, how could they be improved?10\nRegulation and Supervision\nWhile no agency has plenary regulatory or supervisory authority over the U.S.\npayments system, the Board, FDIC, and OCC have certain limited, and in some cases\nunique, statutory authorities that may apply to payments fraud.11 For example, the Board,\nFDIC, and OCC supervise their respective financial institutions for compliance with their\nobligations under the Bank Secrecy Act\/Anti-Money Laundering regime to identify,\nprevent, and report illicit financial activity including fraud. Additionally, the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act requires the protection of nonpublic personal information as\nimplemented by the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security\nStandards.12 The Board, FDIC, and OCC also supervise their respective financial\n10 Examples of online resources include https:\/\/www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov;\nhttps:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org; https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/consumerscommunities\/fraud-\nscams.htm; https:\/\/explore.fednow.org\/explore-the-city?id=11&building=fraud-control-tower;\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/consumer- resource-center\/consumer-assistance-topics;\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/consumer-resource-center\/fdic-consumer-news; https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/publications-\nand-resources\/publications\/safe-money\/index-safe-money.html; and https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/topics\/consumers-\nand-communities\/consumer-protection\/fraud-resources\/index-fraud-resources.html.\n11 While no single Federal agency has regulatory authority to address all aspects of payments fraud, there\nare a variety of Federal and State laws and regulations applicable to payments fraud detection, mitigation,\nand resolution, often specific to the type of transaction and parties involved.\n12 The Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards (Guidelines) set forth standards\npursuant to section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, and sections 501 and\n505(b), 15 U.S.C. 6801 and 6805(b), of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These Guidelines address standards\nfor developing and implementing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security,\nconfidentiality, and integrity of customer information. These Guidelines also address standards with respect\nto the proper disposal of consumer information pursuant to sections 621 and 628 of the Fair Credit\nReporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s and 1681w).\n13 of 22 institutions for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, such as the\nExpedited Funds Availability Act (implemented in Regulation CC), the Electronic Fund\nTransfer Act (implemented in Regulation E), the Truth in Lending Act (implemented in\nRegulation Z), and prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.13\nAlthough the Board, FDIC, and OCC believe that they are exercising their authorities\nappropriately, there may be opportunities to take additional regulatory or supervisory\nactions to address payments fraud within their authorities and, where appropriate, in\ncoordination with other agencies.\nIn considering potential additional regulatory or supervisory actions to mitigate\npayments fraud, the Board, FDIC, and OCC seek comment on the following questions.\nAdditionally, there may be opportunities specific to check fraud that the Board could\nconsider with respect to Regulation CC given its rule-writing authority, which is\ndiscussed separately below.\n9. What potential changes to regulations (apart from the Board\u2019s Regulation CC,\ndiscussed separately below) could address payments fraud and mitigate the harms\nfrom payments fraud to consumers, businesses, and supervised institutions?\n10. The Board, FDIC, and OCC have issued supervisory guidance on numerous\ntopics that relate to payments fraud detection, prevention, and mitigation.14 Is\n13 The Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFA Act), among other things, prescribes the maximum\npermissible hold periods for checks and other deposits. The Board implements certain provisions of the\nEFA Act with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n14 The Board, FDIC, and OCC have issued supervisory guidance on operational risk management,\ncompliance risk management, third-party risk management, and model risk management. For example, the\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council, of which the Board, FDIC, and OCC are members,\nissued guidance that provides financial institutions with examples of effective authentication and access\nrisk management principles, and practices for customers, employees, and third parties accessing digital\nbanking services and information systems. See Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council,\nAuthentication and Access to Financial Institution Services and Systems (Aug. 11, 2021),\n14 of 22 existing supervisory guidance related to payments fraud sufficient and clear? If\nnot, what new or revised supervisory guidance should the Board, FDIC, and OCC\nconsider issuing on this topic within the respective authorities?\n11. How might new or revised supervisory guidance assist small community banks in\ndetecting, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?\n12. What is the experience of consumers and businesses when supervised institutions\nplace holds on depositors\u2019 funds because of suspected payments fraud?\n(Regulation CC\u2019s \u201creasonable cause to doubt collectability\u201d exception is\ndiscussed separately below.)\na) For instance, how frequently are consumers and businesses affected by\nholds, delays, or account freezes, and how responsive are supervised\ninstitutions to inquiries from consumers and businesses regarding these\nissues?\nb) Do current disclosure requirements effectively address consumer and\nbusiness concerns when supervised institutions hold customer funds due to\nsuspected payments fraud? For example, should changes be considered\nwith respect to permissible customer communications under SAR\nconfidentiality rules?\nhttps:\/\/www.ffiec.gov\/guidance\/Authentication-and-Access-to-Financial-Institution-Services-and-\nSystems.pdf. The Board, FDIC, and OCC, together with other Federal and State agencies, issued guidance\non elder financial exploitation. See Interagency Statement on Elder Financial Exploitation (Dec. 4, 2024),\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/pressreleases\/bcreg20241204a.htm;\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/system\/files\/2024-12\/interagency-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation.pdf; and\nhttps:\/\/www.occ.gov\/topics\/consumers-and-communities\/consumer-protection\/fraud-resources\/index-fraud-\nresources.html. As required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Federal banking agencies have issued\ninteragency guidelines establishing information security standards. See, e.g., 12 CFR part 208, app. D-2,\nand part 225, app. F. Finally, OCC Bulletin 2019-37 outlines sound fraud risk management principles at\nhttps:\/\/www.occ.treas.gov\/news-issuances\/bulletins\/2019\/bulletin-2019-37.html.\n15 of 22 13. The Board, FDIC, and OCC have received complaints from supervised\ninstitutions regarding challenges in resolving disputes about liability for allegedly\nfraudulent checks.15 What is the experience of supervised institutions when trying\nto resolve these types of interbank disputes regarding allegedly fraudulent checks?\nDo these types of interbank disputes arise more frequently in connection with\ncertain types of checks or parties? What actions could the Board, FDIC, and OCC\nconsider, including potential amendments by the Board to Regulation CC, that\ncould improve supervised institutions\u2019 ability to resolve interbank disputes over\nliability for allegedly fraudulent checks?\nAlthough the Board is not proposing any changes to Regulation CC at this time,\nthe Board seeks comment on the following questions:\n14. Regulation CC seeks to balance prompt funds availability with the risk of checks\nbeing returned unpaid for reasons that include fraud. What potential amendments\nto Regulation CC would support timely access to funds from check deposits while\nproviding depository institutions with sufficient time to identify suspected\npayments fraud?\na) Have technological advancements in check processing reduced the time it\ntakes for depository institutions to learn of nonpayment or fraud such that\nfunds availability requirements for local checks and nonproprietary ATMs\nshould be shortened?16\n15 The Board, OCC, and FDIC have each established mailboxes to receive interbank complaints about this\nissue concerning their supervised financial institutions.\n16 The funds availability requirements for cash deposits, wire transfers, and government and certain other\ntypes of checks are established by the EFA Act. See 12 U.S.C. 4002(a). The EFA Act requires the Board\nand CFPB to reduce the time periods for certain other check and ATM deposits to as short a time as\n16 of 22 b) What effects would shortening funds availability requirements have on\npayments fraud, consumers who rely on timely access to funds, and\ndepository institutions?\nc) Are there any changes the Board should consider to the expeditious return\nrequirement to better balance providing expeditious notice to the receiving\ndepository institution with ensuring adequate time for the paying\ndepository institution to investigate potentially fraudulent checks?17\n15. Regulation CC provides six exceptions that allow depository institutions to extend\ndeposit hold periods for certain types of deposits, including deposits for which the\ndepository institution has reasonable cause to doubt the collectability of a\ncheck.18 Is this exception effective in allowing depository institutions to mitigate\ncheck fraud while also allowing timely access to funds? Would depository\ninstitutions benefit from further clarification on when it may be appropriate to\ninvoke this exception? What are the experiences of businesses and consumers\nwhen depository institutions invoke this exception in order to delay the\navailability of depositors\u2019 funds?\npossible and equal to the period of time achievable for a receiving depository institution to reasonably\nexpect to learn of the nonpayment of most items for each category. 12 U.S.C. 4002(d)(1). In October\n2024, an interested person submitted a rulemaking petition to the Board and CFPB requesting that both\nagencies engage in a rulemaking process to shorten maximum permissible hold times for checks and funds\ndeposited by customers. The Board views this rulemaking petition as an additional consideration related to\nthe issuance of this RFI. In response to the growth in electronic processing, the Reserve Banks reduced the\nnumber of their paper check-processing offices from 45 in 2003 to a single office in 2010. The\nconsolidation resulted in all checks being considered \"local checks\" under Regulation CC.\n17 Regulation CC requires a depository institution that determines not to pay a check to return the check\nexpeditiously so that receiving depository institutions are more likely to learn of a return before making\nfunds available. See 12 CFR 229.31(b).\n18 See 12 CFR 229.13(e).\n17 of 22 Payments Fraud Data Collection and Information Sharing\nPayments fraud data, such as value and volume of fraudulent payments and\nindustry negative lists, is currently collected in an incomplete, non-standardized, ad hoc,\nand fragmented way.19 For example, not all entities in the payments and banking\nindustry collect payments fraud data, especially authorized payments that are a part of a\nscam or fraud. Further, existing data sources may focus on particular payment methods,\ntypes of payments fraud, or segments of the industry, and may use different definitions of\npayments fraud. Further promoting, standardizing, and centralizing payments fraud data\ncollection and information sharing could provide a more comprehensive understanding of\nthe prevalence and impact of payments fraud. These improvements also could aid in\nidentifying payments fraud schemes that are being repeated across payment methods and\ninstitutions, allowing for the development of more-informed, holistic strategies to address\npayments fraud.\nHowever, there may be barriers to improving payments fraud data collection and\ninformation sharing. Payments fraud may be underreported because of the reluctance of\nvictims to report fraud due to embarrassment or shame, confusion regarding the proper\nreporting channel, and a perception that reporting does not lead to remediation. Further,\n19 For example, the FTC maintains a website where consumers can report payments fraud. See\nhttps:\/\/reportfraud.ftc.gov. The FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center is the main federal law\nenforcement hub for reporting cyber-enabled crime, which includes payments fraud. See\nhttps:\/\/www.ic3.gov\/AnnualReport\/Reports\/2024_IC3Report.pdf. In addition, depository institutions are\nrequired to file SARs with FinCEN following suspected incidents of payments fraud. FRS has previously\ncollected payments fraud data in connection with its Federal Reserve Payments Study, which it published\nin 2014 and 2018. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, The 2013 Federal Reserve\nPayments Study: Recent and Long-Term Payment Trends in the United States: 2000-2012 (July 2014),\nhttps:\/\/www.frbservices.org\/binaries\/content\/assets\/crsocms\/news\/research\/2013-fed-res-paymt-study-\ndetailed-rpt.pdf. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Changes in U.S. Payments Fraud\nfrom 2012 to 2016: Evidence from the Federal Reserve Payments Study (Oct. 2018),\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/publications\/files\/changes-in-us-payments-fraud-from-2012-to-2016-\n20181016.pdf.\n18 of 22 potential risks associated with sharing payments fraud\u2013related information may prevent\nsharing across stakeholders.\nTo assist in potentially promoting improved payments fraud data collection and\ninformation sharing, commenters are invited to respond to the following questions:\n16. Broadly, how could payments fraud data collection and information sharing be\nimproved?\n17. What barriers limit the collection and sharing of payments fraud data between\nindustry stakeholders, and how could these barriers be alleviated? For example,\nhave specific barriers limited development of solutions or participation in\nbilaterial or multilateral payments fraud data collection and information sharing?\nWhat changes would address these barriers?\n18. What role should the FRS, FDIC, or OCC take in supporting further\nstandardization of payments fraud data? For instance, can the FRS better leverage\nor improve the FraudClassifierSM and ScamClassifierSM models?\n19. What types of payments fraud data, if available, would have the largest impact on\naddressing payments fraud? If these data are not currently being collected or\nshared, what entities are best positioned to collect and share such data?\n20. Is there a need for centralized databases or repositories for the sharing of\npayments fraud data across entities? What legal, privacy, or practical risks and\nchallenges could such a centralized database or repository pose? Which entities\nare best positioned to develop and participate in a centralized database or\nrepository?\n19 of 22 Reserve Banks\u2019 Operator Tools and Services\nThe Reserve Banks offer check processing, ACH transfers, instant payments, and\nwire services, among other services. In this operational role, the Reserve Banks have\ntaken important steps to prevent and mitigate payments fraud. For example, the Reserve\nBanks provide risk management tools and services that participating financial institutions\nmay use as part of their payments fraud detection, prevention, and mitigation programs.20\nThe FRS believes that there may be further opportunities for the Reserve Banks, as a\npayments system operator, to provide additional tools and services designed to reduce\npayments fraud.\nIn considering potential additional actions the Reserve Banks can take in their\noperator role to mitigate payments fraud, commenters are invited to respond to the\nfollowing questions:\n21. How can the Reserve Banks enhance their existing risk management tools and\nservices, operations, rules, or procedures to better meet the needs of participating\nfinancial institutions in addressing payments fraud? For example, should the\nReserve Banks consider requiring fraud reporting for payment rails (as they\nalready do for the FedNow\u00ae Service) or adopting any particular payments fraud\nstandards?\n20 See https:\/\/www.frbservices.org for more information on Reserve Bank financial services, including risk\nmanagement and fraud tools and services. Examples of these tools and services include FedDetect\u00ae\nAnomaly Notification for FedACH\u00ae Services, FedACH\u00ae Exception Resolution Service, FedDetect\u00ae\nDuplicate Notification for Check Services, FedACH\u00ae Risk Origination Monitoring Service, FedACH\u00ae\nRDFI File Alert Service, FedPayments\u00ae Reporter for Check Services Corporate Payor Report, FedNow\u00ae\nService network- and participant-level transaction limits, and FedNow\u00ae Service participant defined\nnegative lists.\n20 of 22 22. Are there risk management tools or services that the Reserve Banks should\nconsider offering or expanding, such as a) developing a payments fraud contact\ndirectory for financial institutions, b) offering tools that can provide notification\nof atypical payment activity, or c) introducing confirmation of payee services to\nhelp mitigate fraudulent payment origination?21\nGeneral Questions\nIn addition to the more specific questions above, commenters are invited to\nrespond to the following general questions related to payments fraud:\n23. What types of payments fraud have most impacted your organization and its\nstakeholders? What tactics have criminals employed when perpetrating these\ntypes of payments fraud?\n24. What measures, including technological solutions or services, have been most\neffective in identifying, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud at your\ninstitution? Are there actions that consumers can take that help institutions? For\nexample, do financial institutions find it helpful when consumers alert the\ninstitution in advance when making large purchases, transferring large amounts of\nmoney, and traveling abroad?\n25. To the extent not already addressed here, are there other actions that would\nsupport stakeholders in identifying, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?\n21 Some payments systems have implemented services known as confirmation of payee, which are designed\nto reduce payments fraud by enabling senders to review key payment information, such as the name\nassociated with the intended account.\n21 of 22 26. Are there specific actions that commenters believe could encourage the use of\npayment methods with strong security features?\nThe Honorable Rodney E.

Home Topics Consumers & Communities Consumer Protection Fraud Resources Check Fraud Share This Page: This fraud involves the unauthorized use of a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s checks. How It Works Check fraud occurs when an unauthorized person uses someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s checks, or images of a check, to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals. Common Methods of Check Fraud Check fraud: Scammers steal, or forge checks to make unauthorized transactions. Check washing: Fraudsters alter or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwash\u00e2\u0080\u009d legitimate checks with chemicals to erase the ink from a check to rewrite amounts and payees. Mail fraud: Defrauding others by sending or receiving fraudulent checks through the mail. Warning Signs Unfamiliar checking account transactions appear on your bank statements. Your bank notifies you of unauthorized account activity. You receive calls from your bank about checks you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write or transactions you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make. Someone unsolicited contacts you with a request to deposit a check for any reason, especially to make money on a limited time offer of any kind. You receive a check in the mail related to employment as a mystery shopper, personal assistant, or for being the winner of a prize. Ways to Avoid It Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Set up account alerts for all transactions and review your statements frequently for unauthorized charges or unusual and suspicious activity. Use black gel ink on checks: Black gel ink is highly resistant to check washing, a common scheme where chemicals are used to erase ink from a check to rewrite amounts and payees. Get mail promptly after delivery and avoid leaving mail in your mailbox overnight. When sending checks, consider using the letter slots in your post office to send mail. Be wary of sending money or any medium of payment to someone after taking a check from them for any reason. Scammers often claim overpayment or demand you send or wire money after they give you a bad check. Ways to Report It Taking prompt and comprehensive action when faced with check fraud can help mitigate any potential damage and ensure that the fraudulent charges are resolved effectively. Notify your financial institution Bank: Inform your bank about the fraudulent transaction. Dispute any unauthorized charges and consider requesting your account be closed and a new account opened. Report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Online: Submit a complaint to the IC3, a division of the FBI. This is especially useful for internet-related crimes. Report the fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Online: Visit the FTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IdentityTheft.gov to report the theft and create a recovery plan.

Home Topics Consumers & Communities Consumer Protection Fraud Resources Consumer Product and Retail Fraud Share This Page: This fraud involves the purchase or sale of goods, often through deceptive marketing or counterfeit products. How It Works Consumer product and retail fraud involves scams related to the purchase and sale of goods. Fraudsters might sell counterfeit goods or use fake retail sites to steal money from consumers. Common Methods of Consumer Product and Retail Fraud Counterfeit goods: Selling fake or substandard products at high prices or selling high-end products at \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo good to be true\u00e2\u0080\u009d prices. Online auction scams: Scammers lure buyers with fake auction listings and collect payment without delivering the item. Retail return fraud: Individuals use various deceptive methods such as a false identity to return products for a refund, store credit, or exchange. Warning Signs Deeply discounted products or offers that seem too good to be true. Sellers who request unusual payment methods, like wire transfers, gift cards, or cryptocurrency. Little to no information about the seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company, including no return policy or contact details. Receiving counterfeit goods or items that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t match the advertised product description. Misleading advertising: False claims about a product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities or features. Non-delivery of goods: Payment made but no product received. Warranty and return scams: Issues with a product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warranty or return policy deception. Ways to Avoid It Research sellers: Only buy from reputable retailers and read customer reviews before making purchases. Be skeptical of deals: If a deal seems too good to be true, it likely is. Avoid offers that promise unusually low prices. Review return policies: Ensure the seller has clear return and refund policies and avoid purchasing from sites that lack transparency. Ways to Report It Fraudsters use counterfeit goods, online auction scams, and retail return fraud to deceive consumers into paying for products they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive or that are of inferior quality. Contact the seller or manufacturer Customer service: Reach out to the seller or manufacturer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer service to report the issue and seek resolution. Return policy: If applicable, use the return or exchange policy. Report the fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Online: Visit ReportFraud.ftc.gov to report the fraud.

Fraudsters exploit the popularity of gift cards as convenient presents by tricking individuals into purchasing gift cards for fictitious reasons or stealing funds from purchased cards. These scams are particularly effective during the holiday rush, as people may be less vigilant and more likely to fall for high-pressure tactics or deals that appear time-sensitive. How It Works Scammers exploit the increased financial activity that occurs during the holiday season when consumers can be distracted to carry out a range of fraudulent schemes. Common Methods of Holiday and Gift Card Scams Delivery scams: Scammers may take advantage of increased package deliveries by sending fake notifications about undelivered packages to trick recipients into providing personal information or payment details. Gift card fraud: Scammers trick victims into paying for services or fines using gift cards, or they steal the balance from legitimate gift cards. Holiday shopping scams: Fake holiday sales or promotions lure consumers into making purchases from fraudulent websites, but the customer never receives their items. Phony charities: Fraudsters create fake charities during the holiday season to exploit people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goodwill and collect donations that are never used for the stated cause. Seasonal employment scams: During the holiday season, many people seek temporary jobs in retail, delivery services, and other industries. Scammers exploit this demand by posting fake job listings. Victims are sometimes asked to provide personal information, pay upfront fees, or work without compensation.

Victims may pay upfront, only to find the tickets or bookings do not exist. Warning Signs Requests for payment via gift cards for services or fines.

Ways to Avoid It Purchase gift cards directly: Buy gift cards from trusted retailers, either online or in-store, and avoid third-party sellers. Never pay a third party with gift cards: No legitimate company will ask for payments using gift cards. If someone does, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scam. Be cautious of unsolicited offers: Ignore unsolicited emails or social media messages offering free or discounted gift cards. Check the gift card before purchase: Ensure the card hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been tampered with before purchasing, especially the area where the code is located.

Home News & Events Newsroom OCC Bulletin 2024-19 | July 19, 2024 Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Program Requirements: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Share This Page: ToChief Executive Officers of All National Banks, Federal Savings Associations, and Federal Branches and Agencies; Department and Division Heads; All Examining Personnel; and Other Interested Parties Summary On July 19, 2024, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration (collectively, the agencies) issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend the requirements that each agency has issued for its supervised banks, currently referred to as Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance programs, to establish, implement, and maintain effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) programs. The amendments align with changes that are being concurrently proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a result of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act). The agencies and FinCEN are also issuing a joint statement that describes their proposed rules and the additional steps necessary to implement the AML Act. Note for Community Bank The proposed amendments would apply to all national banks and all federal savings associations, including community banks. Highlights The notice of proposed rulemaking would propose the following changes, among others: Incorporating a risk assessment process in AML\/CFT program rules that would require, among other things, consideration of national AML\/CFT priorities published by FinCEN. Including customer due diligence requirements to reflect prior amendments to FinCEN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirements. Including amendments to codify longstanding supervisory expectations and conform to changes made by the AML Act. Encouraging, but not requiring, banks to consider, evaluate, and as appropriate, implement innovative approaches to meet compliance obligations pursuant to the BSA. Background Pursuant to the AML Act, FinCEN is amending its BSA compliance program rules to incorporate national AML\/CFT priorities and other changes. The agencies have independent authority to prescribe regulations requiring banks to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor their compliance with the requirements of the BSA. The agencies are proposing to amend their rules concurrently with FinCEN. In 2016, FinCEN amended its AML compliance program rules to incorporate customer due diligence (CDD) requirements, adding beneficial ownership information collection requirements into FinCEN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AML compliance program rule for certain financial institutions, including banks. The proposed rule would add CDD as a required component of the agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 AML\/CFT program rules, which would mirror FinCEN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing rule.

BSA\/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Examinations The OCC conducts regular examinations of national banks, federal savings associations, federal branches, and agencies of foreign banks in the U.S. to determine compliance with the BSA. BSA & Related Regulations The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 USC 5311 et seq establishes program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for national banks, federal savings associations, federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. The OCC's implementing regulations are found at 12 CFR 21.11 and 12 CFR 21.21. The BSA was amended to incorporate the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act which requires every bank to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program. BSA Law Enforcement Tools and Resources In addition to utilizing information filed by banks in money laundering and terrorist financing investigations, U.S. law enforcement also provides banks with access to resources and tools such as those listed here that can be used to strengthen your BSA\/AML risk management programs. BSA\/AML Bulletins, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Advisories, & Related BASEL Information The OCC and the U.S. Department of Treasury periodically issue alerts, advisories and rulemakings concerning institutions or individuals who may be engaged in fraudulent activities or be deemed to be of high-risk for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. BSA\/AML Innovative Industry Approaches & Other Related Links The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the National Credit Union Administration issued a statement encouraging banks to take innovative approaches to meet their Bank Secrecy Act\/anti-money laundering (BSA\/AML) compliance obligations and further strengthen the financial system against illicit financial activity. Counter-Terrorist Financing U.S. banks play a key role in combating the financing of terrorism by identifying and reporting potentially suspicious activity as required under the BSA. A number of resources are available to assist you in this effort. Money Laundering Criminals have long used money-laundering schemes to conceal or \"clean\" the source of fraudulently obtained or stolen funds. Money laundering poses significant risks to the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial industry. With the advent of terrorists who employ money-laundering techniques to fund their operations, the risk expands to encompass the safety and security of the nation. Through sound operations, banks play an important role in helping investigative and regulatory agencies identify money-laundering entities and take appropriate action. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and related anti-money laundering laws, banks must Establish effective BSA compliance programs Establish effective customer due diligence systems and monitoring programs Screen against Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and other government lists Establish an effective suspicious activity monitoring and reporting process Develop risk-based anti-money laundering programs Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) As of April 1, 2013, financial institutions must use the Bank Secrecy Act BSA E-Filing System in order to submit Suspicious Activity Reports. A financial institution is required to file a suspicious activity report no later than 30 calendar days after the date of initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a suspicious activity report. If no suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident requiring the filing, a financial institution may delay filing a suspicious activity report for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), financial institutions are required to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering, such as: Keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, File reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and Report suspicious activity that might signal criminal activity (e.g., money laundering, tax evasion) An amendment to the BSA incorporates provisions of the USA Patriot Act, which requires every bank to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program.

Removal of reputation risk references is identified by a strikethrough. Refer to OCC Bulletin 2025-4. Summary The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is issuing this bulletin to inform national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies (collectively, banks) of sound fraud risk management principles. This bulletin supplements other OCC and interagency issuances on corporate and risk governance, including the references listed in appendix A of this bulletin. Note for Community Banks This guidance applies to all OCC-supervised banks. Highlights The risk management principles addressed in this bulletin include the following: A bank should have sound corporate governance practices that instill a corporate culture of ethical standards and promote employee accountability. A bank's risk management system should include policies, processes, personnel, and control systems to effectively identify, measure, monitor, and control fraud risk consistent with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile. A bank's risk management system and system of internal controls should be designed to prevent and detect fraud. appropriately respond to fraud, suspected fraud, or allegations of fraud. Bank management should assess the likelihood and impact of potential fraud schemes and use the results of this assessment to inform the design of the bank's risk management system. Senior management and the board of directors should measure, monitor, and understand fraud losses across the enterprise and employ tools that appropriately quantify and assess loss experience and exposure. Control reviews and audits should include fraud risk as part of their assessments. Fraud risk management principles can be implemented in a variety of ways and may not always be structured within a formal fraud risk management program. Regardless of the structure, fraud risk management should be commensurate with the bank's risk profile. Banks with significant and far-reaching retail-oriented business activities should have well-documented fraud risk management programs with appropriate monitoring, measurements and reporting, and mitigation. Background Fraud may generally be characterized as an intentional act, misstatement, or omission designed to deceive others, resulting in the victim suffering a loss or the perpetrator achieving a gain.1 Fraud is typically categorized as internal or external. Internal fraud occurs when a director, an employee, a former employee, or a third party engaged by the bank commits fraud, colludes to commit fraud, or otherwise enables or contributes to fraud. External fraud consists of first-party fraud and victim fraud. External fraud is committed by a person or entity that is not a bank employee, a former employee, or a third party engaged by the bank. First-party fraud occurs when an external party, including a bank customer, commits fraud against the bank. Victim fraud occurs when a bank customer or client is the victim of an intentional fraudulent act. Fraud schemes are often ongoing crimes that can go undetected for months or even years and can be time consuming and costly to address. It is often difficult to fully understand and quantify the extent of the fraud and the harm caused. Measuring losses associated with fraud is often an inexact process. Typically, the true cost of fraud is greater than the direct financial loss, given the time and expense to investigate, loss of productivity, potential legal and compliance costs associated with remediation, and impact on a bank's reputation. Fraud risk is a form of operational risk, which is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events.2 Operational risk management weaknesses can result in heightened exposure to fraudulent activities, which can increase a bank's exposure to reputation and strategic risks. Failure to maintain an appropriate risk management system could expose the bank to the risk of significant fraud, defalcation (e.g., misappropriation of funds by an employee), and other operational losses. Governance Strong governance is of paramount importance to controlling the bank's exposure to fraud, and a strong corporate culture against fraud is crucial regardless of a bank's size or complexity. The tone at the top sets the foundation on which the bank operates. The board and senior management have a responsibility to lead by example and demonstrate that the bank is serious about promoting ethical behavior to deter and prevent fraud. The board-adopted code of ethics (or code of conduct) should encourage the timely communication and escalation of suspected fraud through the appropriate oversight channel. The board is ultimately responsible for oversight but may delegate fraud risk management-related duties to specific committees (for example, the audit committee or operational risk management committee). The board also may delegate anti-fraud responsibilities to specific executives and managers, including those in charge of managing risks and controls. Roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined. The board should hold management accountable for effective fraud risk management and alignment of anti-fraud efforts with the bank's strategy, objectives, risk appetite, and operational plans. While not all fraud can be avoided, an active board can foster an environment in which fraud is more likely to be prevented, deterred, and promptly detected. A sound corporate culture should discourage imprudent risk-taking. Incentives or requirements for employees to meet sales goals, financial performance goals, and other business goals, particularly if such goals are aggressive, can result in heightened fraud risk.3 Risk Management Sound fraud risk management principles should be integrated within the bank's risk management system commensurate with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile. Bank management should periodically assess the likelihood and impact of potential fraud schemes and use the documented results of this assessment to inform the design of the bank's risk management system and evaluate fraud control activities. Policies should clearly define, establish, and communicate the board's and senior management's commitment to fraud risk management. Processes should be designed to anticipate fraud and deploy a combination of preventive controls and detective controls. Detective controls are important because even with strong governance and oversight, collusion or circumvention of internal controls can allow fraud to occur. Some practices and controls may be both preventive and detective in nature. Preventive controls are designed to deter fraud or minimize its likelihood. The following are some examples: Policies and processes (e.g., ethics policies, code of conduct, identity theft program,4 and elder abuse policies) Anti-fraud awareness campaigns for board, senior management, staff, and third parties Fraud risk management training for employees and contractors commensurate with roles and responsibilities Customer education on fraud risks and preventive measures customers can take to reduce the risk of becoming victims System controls designed to prevent employees, agents, third parties, and others from conducting fraudulent transactions, performing inappropriate manual overrides, or manipulating financial reporting Controls to prevent fraudulent account opening, closing, or transactions Dual controls (e.g., over monetary instruments, accounting, customer transactions, and reporting) Segregation of duties Background investigations for new employees and periodic checks for existing employees and third parties Training customer-facing employees to identify potential victim fraud Sound information security programs5 Job breaks, such as mandatory consecutive two-week vacations or rotation of duties Customer identification program procedures, customer due diligence processes, and beneficial ownership identification and verification6 Real-time transaction analysis and behavioral analytics Detective controls are designed to identify and respond to fraud after it has occurred. The following are some examples: Models, monitoring systems, or reports designed to detect fraudulent activity across all lines of business and functions (e.g., exception reports, unusual card activity, unauthorized transactions, file maintenance reports, fee waiver analysis, and employee surveillance processes [account monitoring, system access patterns, and overrides]) Data analytics (e.g., loss data analysis, transactions, fee waivers, interest forgiven, charge-offs, errors, and consumer complaint data) Effective complaint resolution processes7 Monitoring and analysis of civil and criminal subpoenas received by the bank or information requests under section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act8 Monitoring and analysis of Bank Secrecy Act report filings by the bank and its affiliates Monitoring of news and other information concerning civil and criminal lawsuits Ethics and whistleblower reporting channels or hotlines Exit interviews for departing employees Software and technology tools, developed internally or purchased from a third party, can assist with anti-fraud efforts. Bank management should consider the cost and value of fraud prevention tools selected, consistent with the bank's overall strategy, complexity, and risk profile. Depending on the specific products and services offered, management might deploy solutions that serve to detect anomalies and prevent potential fraudulent transactions or activities. These solutions can monitor transactions and behaviors, employ layered or multifactor authentication, monitor networks for intrusions or malware, analyze transactions on internal bank platforms, and compare data with consortium or publicly available data. Banks' fraud prevention and detection tools should evolve and adapt to remain effective against emerging fraud types. Fraud Risk Measurement and Monitoring Senior management should understand the bank's exposure to fraud risk and associated losses across all business lines and functions and use this information to effectively monitor and manage fraud risk. The board should receive regular reporting on the bank's fraud risk assessment, resulting exposure to fraud risk, and associated losses to enable directors to understand the bank's fraud risk profile. Reporting should allow management and directors to measure performance. Practices can include benchmarking current fraud losses against loss history or industry data. Examples of metrics and analysis banks can use to measure and monitor fraud risk include the following: Metrics by fraud type (e.g., internal, external, loan, card, account opening, check, or embezzlement) Fraud losses (e.g., per open account, closed account, or litigation) Fraud recoveries Net fraud losses Fraud loss budget variance Automated clearing house return rates Percentage of customers claiming victim fraud Fraud control performance and control testing results Trend analysis of data such as number and dollar of fraud investigations customer complaints Bank Secrecy Act report metrics (e.g., Suspicious Activity Report [SAR] filings) civil and criminal subpoenas information requests under section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act Management should identify fraud losses as internal or external. Larger, more complex banks generally maintain this information in an operational loss database or similar system.9 Fraud Response, Reporting, and Information Sharing A bank's policies, processes, and control systems should prompt appropriate and timely investigations into, responses to, and reporting of suspected and confirmed fraud. Banks should have processes for internal investigations, law enforcement referrals, regulatory notifications,10 and reporting. A bank is required to file a SAR for known or suspected fraud meeting regulatory thresholds.11 Reporting mechanisms should relay relevant, accurate, and timely fraud-related information from all lines of business to appropriate oversight channels. Sound fraud risk management processes can include voluntary sharing of information with other financial institutions under section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act. Pursuant to section 314(b), before exchanging information, the bank must register with the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Current section 314(b) participants may share information with one another regarding individuals, entities, organizations, and countries for purposes of identifying and, when appropriate, reporting activities that may involve possible specified unlawful activities. FinCEN has issued guidance clarifying that, if section 314(b) participants suspect that transactions may involve the proceeds of specified unlawful activities, such as fraud, under the money laundering statutes,12 information related to such transactions can be shared under the protection of the section 314(b) safe harbor.13 Reviews and Audits A bank should design and perform reviews and audits specific to the bank's size, complexity, organizational structure, and risk profile. Reviews and audits should be designed to assess the effectiveness of the bank's internal controls and fraud risk management. Effective internal and external audit programs are a critical defense against fraud and provide vital information to the board of directors about the effectiveness of internal control systems. Reviews and audits typically include the following:14 Quality assurance and quality control reviews Independent risk management reviews Internal and external audits Retrospective reviews after fraud is identified Third-party relationship audits (or audit reports) consistent with contractual provisions When auditing financial statements and asserting effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, auditors must consider a material misstatement due to fraud.15 If the auditor identifies that fraud may be present, the auditor must discuss these findings with the board or management in a timely fashion.16 The auditor must also determine whether they have a responsibility to report the suspected fraud to the OCC.17 Findings and results from audits and reviews should be communicated to the relevant parties in a timely manner. Management should take timely and effective corrective action in response to deficiencies identified. Further Information Please contact Tanya A.

Home News & Events Newsroom OCC Bulletin 2024-29 | October 3, 2024 Commercial Lending: Refinance Risk Share This Page: ToChief Executive Officers of All National Banks, Federal Savings Associations, and Federal Branches and Agencies; Department and Division Heads; All Examining Personnel; and Other Interested Parties Summary The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is issuing this bulletin to provide banks1 with guidance for managing credit risk associated with refinance risk. This bulletin does not address other risks, such as interest rate risk.2 Recission This bulletin rescinds Banking Bulletin 1993-50, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLoan Refinancing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Note for Community Banks This bulletin applies to all banks with commercial loans. Highlights This bulletin discusses the effect of refinance risk on credit risk in commercial loan transactions and portfolios. provides guidance on transaction and portfolio-level refinance risk management. Background Refinance risk is the risk that borrowers will not be able to replace existing debt at a future date under reasonable terms and prevailing market conditions. Refinance risk increases in rising interest rate environments and can be amplified by large volumes of loans set to mature in underperforming markets.3 If a borrower cannot refinance under current market conditions, a bank could be burdened with an underperforming or nonperforming loan. Refinance risk primarily affects loans with principal balances remaining at maturity and borrowers who rely on recurring debt to finance their capital structure or business operations. Examples of loan types most affected by refinance risk include interest-only loans, commercial real estate loans,4 leveraged loans, and revolving working capital lines. Fully amortizing loans to sound borrowers generally have lower refinance risk than loans that are not fully amortizing. Refinance risk affects individual loans and portfolios of loans. A concentration in such loans could increase the cost and complexity of problem loan resolutions when borrowers are under stress. In addition, if a significant volume or amount of loans refinance during adverse economic conditions, it could constrain a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital or liquidity, threaten earnings, or hinder strategic initiatives.5 Refinance risk can be driven by external factors or borrower-specific factors. External factors that affect refinance risk include investor risk appetite and market liquidity; the current interest rate environment; inflation; or supply chain effects on the costs of goods, services, or labor. Refinance risk increases in rising interest rate environments because borrowers may be unable to service their debt at higher interest rates upon refinance. Refinance risk may also increase for some borrowers or portfolios because of declining industry fundamentals or changes in commodity prices. Borrower-specific drivers for heightened refinance risk include high leverage, constrained liquidity, a significant volume of near-term maturities, poor financial performance, or unpopular market sentiment. Guidance Banks should have processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control refinance risk at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The tools to monitor refinance risk should be tailored to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size, complexity, risk profile, and types of lending. Sound transaction-level credit risk management practices include assessing refinance risk at underwriting, during ongoing monitoring, and near maturity. At the portfolio level, banks should have systems and processes to monitor the volume and cadence of upcoming loan maturities. Independent credit risk review should consider the level of refinance risk when determining an appropriate review scope and assessing credit quality.6 One common method to assess refinance risk at the transaction and portfolio level is multivariable stress testing. Transaction-level stress testing can provide insight into the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to meet refinancing requirements if the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial condition declines or market conditions deteriorate (e.g., interest rates increase, market terms tighten, expenses increase, or collateral values fall). Portfolio-level stress testing can identify and measure the potential effect of changing market conditions on portfolio segments with higher refinance risk.7 Transaction-Level Risk Management and Risk-Rating Considerations Banks should evaluate refinance risk when approving and structuring loans, during ongoing monitoring (e.g., annual reviews), near loan maturity, and when considering granting extensions or renewals. Refinance risk can also be a factor when risk-rating a loan. A prudent assessment of refinance risk includes a borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refinancing needs, the performance of the underlying project or asset, the timing of a refinancing transaction (e.g., maturity), the amount and maturity dates of other debt, current market liquidity, and the cost of refinancing. At origination, banks can structure a loan to mitigate refinance risk. For example, underwriting standards may include debt service coverage or loan-to-value requirements that provide a cushion if a borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial condition declines or market conditions deteriorate. Banks may also require covenants that preserve the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to refinance (e.g., leverage covenants or limits on incremental debt) or trigger action before maturity to protect the bank (e.g., debt service coverage ratios or liquidity ratios). During ongoing monitoring and near maturity, management should conduct analysis to determine the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refinance requirements and ability to reasonably qualify for another market rate loan to cover the projected outstanding principal. The analysis can also provide insight into the likelihood that a borrower might seek refinancing prior to maturity (e.g., to support significant business expansion, because of a leveraged buyout, or to pay out a retiring partner). Effective analysis of refinance risk includes a loan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance compared with expectations at underwriting, the time horizon for a refinance event, borrower-specific factors, and external factors. Analysis should include determining whether a borrower can meet current underwriting standards, including prevailing interest rates, for similar loans. Banks should have refinance plans in place for borrowers with near-term refinancing needs. While market demand could affect a borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to refinance, generally the stronger a borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underlying financial performance, the more refinance options are available. For loans maturing with an outstanding principal balance or otherwise likely to require near-term refinancing, credit risk ratings should take into account the likelihood that the borrower will be able to obtain refinancing without relying on distressed terms. Refinance risk is just one consideration in determining an appropriate risk rating and should be evaluated in the context of the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall financial condition and debt service ability. While increased refinance risk does not automatically warrant a change in a loan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk rating, classification is appropriate when there are well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize repayment. Loans that are adequately protected by the current sound worth and debt service ability of the borrower, guarantor, or the underlying collateral8 generally are not adversely classified.9 Similarly, loans to sound borrowers that are modified in accordance with prudent underwriting standards are generally not adversely classified unless well-defined weaknesses exist that jeopardize repayment. Such loans, however, could be flagged for management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention or for inclusion in designated \u00e2\u0080\u009cwatch lists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Portfolio-Level Analysis and Risk Management Banks should have processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control refinance risk at the portfolio level. Assessing refinance risk at the portfolio level allows a bank to identify borrowers experiencing similar stresses, whether macroeconomic or specific to an industry or region. Effective processes generally include the ability to identify and monitor the volume and amount of loans maturing with outstanding principal balances and portfolio segments affected by external risk factors. stress-testing to identify portfolios with heightened refinance risk. limits that reflect the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk appetite. reporting that monitors the level of refinance risk and performance relative to established limits. A bank can mitigate refinance risk by establishing criteria that define when it is appropriate to underwrite loans that will not fully amortize by maturity (e.g., interest-only loans, loans with balloon payments, or revolving loans) and prudent terms for such loans (e.g., re-margining requirements, covenants, or cleanup requirements). Underwriting criteria can also detail the prudent use of interest rate swaps and caps. Banks can further mitigate refinance risk by setting appropriate underwriting exception limits, controls, and reporting (e.g., limiting loans underwritten with covenant-lite structures or with marginal debt service coverage or loan-to-value ratios). Setting and adhering to concentration limits can protect the balance sheet from potential refinancing shocks and bank capital from outsized losses when refinance options are limited. Refinance risk can occur across different lending products, and it is prudent for management to consider whether refinance risk creates correlated exposures not otherwise identified, especially during a deteriorating economic environment.10 Loans Restructured Under a Prudent Loan Workout Plan The OCC encourages banks to work proactively and prudently with borrowers who are, or may be, unable to meet their contractual payment obligations during periods of financial stress. An effective loan workout arrangement should improve the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prospects for repayment of principal and interest, be consistent with sound banking and accounting practices, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.11 Management should consider refinance risk when developing an effective workout strategy. In some cases, as part of a prudent workout plan, a loan originally underwritten with fully amortizing terms is restructured with an outstanding principal payment at maturity. Management should appropriately risk-rate and manage such loans. Management should also measure and monitor the volume of modified and restructured loans. When assessing refinance risk at the portfolio level, management should consider the volume of modified or restructured loans that will no longer fully amortize by maturity. If management determines that a loan refinance represents a modification or accommodation to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty,12 management should perform further analysis to determine whether the loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans and should be reviewed individually when determining an appropriate allowance for credit loss. Management should also determine whether the loan is collateral-dependent.13 Further Information Please contact Barry Mills, Director for Commercial Credit Risk Policy, at (202) 649-6220. Grovetta N.

Home News & Events Newsroom OCC Bulletin 2020-107 | December 2, 2020 Temporary Asset Thresholds: Interim Final Rule Share This Page: ToChief Executive Officers of All National Banks and Federal Savings Associations, Department and Division Heads, All Examining Personnel, and Other Interested Parties Summary On December 2, 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), together with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the agencies), issued an interim final rule to temporarily mitigate transition costs related to the coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) pandemic on community banking organizations, including national banks and federal savings associations, with less than $10 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019. The rule allows these organizations to use asset data as of December 31, 2019, to determine the applicability of various regulatory asset thresholds during calendar years 2020 and 2021. The OCC also intends to provide similar flexibility to community banking organizations crossing other thresholds in OCC regulations that are not specifically addressed in this rule. Note for Community Banks The rule applies to community banks with total assets of less than $10 billion as of December 31, 2019. Highlights Community banking organizations have played an instrumental role in the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial response to COVID-19, and many have experienced significant balance-sheet growth as a result of the pandemic and the policy response to it. Much of this growth, particularly that related to participation in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), is expected to be temporary. Community banking organizations are subject to a wide range of statutory requirements, regulations, and reporting requirements predicated on their risk profile and asset size. Due to their response to COVID-19, many community banking organizations have been, or may soon be, pushed over an asset threshold that could subject them to additional regulation or to additional reporting requirements. This rule gives community banking organizations more time to either reduce their balance sheets by shedding temporary growth or prepare for higher regulatory and reporting standards. To provide this regulatory burden relief, the rule temporarily changes, for a number of asset-based regulatory thresholds, the date as of when a community banking organization measures its assets for the purpose of determining whether it exceeds a threshold. Specifically, the rule will permit community banking organizations, through December 31, 2021, to determine the applicability of certain asset-based regulatory thresholds using asset data as of December 31, 2019, if the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assets as of that date were less than its assets on the date as of which the applicability of a given threshold would normally be determined. This means that asset growth in 2020 or 2021 will not trigger new regulatory requirements for these community banking organizations until January 1, 2022, at the earliest. This temporary regulatory burden relief reflects that much of the asset growth since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially growth related to PPP lending, is generally expected to be temporary in nature and therefore likely does not reflect changes in community banking organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk profiles. Specifically, the rule provides OCC-supervised institutions with temporary relief from the asset thresholds in the following rules: The $10 billion threshold in the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 12 CFR 3.12; The $10 billion threshold in the Board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debit card interchange fee regulation at 12 CFR 235.5; The $5 billion threshold for eligibility for reduced reporting requirements for the call report at 12 CFR 52.2; and The $3 billion threshold for eligibility for an 18-month examination cycle at 12 CFR 4.6(b) and 4.7(b).

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-7 | January 31, 2025 OCC Promotes 2025 Earned Income Tax Credit Awareness Day Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094To help increase familiarity with the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is joining other agencies in promoting January 31 as EITC Awareness Day. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the EITC and its positive impact on America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working families. The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit for low- to moderate-income households. The EITC can reduce the amount of taxes owed on a worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earned income and, in some cases, increase the worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refund. Millions of workers may be eligible for EITC for the first time based on changes to their financial situation or their marital or parental status. Families with children may receive a refund of up to $7,830. Banks can play an important role by informing customers about EITC and reminding them to review qualifications to determine eligibility, including: having an earned income under $66,819 in tax year 2024, depending on marital or parental status. having investment income below $11,600 in the tax year 2024. having a valid Social Security number by the due date of the 2024 return. being a U.S. citizen or a resident alien during the entire 2024 tax year. In addition to promoting EITC awareness, the OCC encourages banks and federal savings associations to: share information about the EITC with their customers and stakeholders using social media or customer email and mailing lists. provide and promote low-cost bank products and services that enable tax refund recipients to deposit their income tax refunds directly into their accounts. inform customers about ways to use tax refunds to pay down debt and build savings. sponsor IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs in branches and support employees who volunteer as tax preparers in low- to moderate-income communities. OCC Community Affairs Officers can provide national banks and federal savings associations with information about the EITC and other initiatives. The OCC Fact Sheet on Leveraging Earned Income Tax Credits to Reach New Bank Customers is another resource available to banks and savings associations.

On March 31, 2025, the OCC withdrew its participation in the principles.4\nII. Rescission of Guidance\nThe agencies\u2019 existing safety and soundness standards require all insured depository\ninstitutions to have effective risk management processes commensurate with the size, complexity\nand risk of their activities.5 In addition, financial institutions of all sizes are expected to consider\nand appropriately address all material risks in their operating environment and should be resilient\nto a range of risks, including emerging risks.6 The agencies do not believe principles for the\nmanagement of climate-related financial risk are necessary and are concerned that such\nprinciples could distract from the management of other potential risks identified and addressed\nby financial institutions\u2019 existing risk management processes and the agencies\u2019 other risk\nmanagement rules and guidance. 7 Therefore, the principles are rescinded.\nIII.Administrative Law Matters\n3 In this issuance, the term \u201cfinancial institution\u201d or \u201cinstitution\u201d includes national banks, Federal savings\nassociations, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, state nonmember banks, state savings associations, state\nmember banks, bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, intermediate holding companies,\nforeign banking organizations with respect to their U.S. operations, and non-bank systemically important financial\ninstitutions (SIFIs) supervised by the Board.\n4 OCC Withdraws Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, News\nRelease 2025-27 (March 31, 2025).\n5 Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, requires the FDIC, Board, and OCC to\nprescribe safety and soundness standards for insured depository institutions. Such standards were implemented by\nrule in 12 CFR part 364, appendix A (FDIC), 12 CFR part 208, appendix D-1 (Board), and 12 CFR part 30,\nappendix A (OCC). These guidelines address, among other things, operational and managerial standards relating to\n(1)internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit\nunderwriting; and (4) interest rate risk exposure.\n6 See, e.g., SR Letter 95-51 (as revised June 23, 2025); SR Letter 21-3 (February 26, 2021); OCC Comptroller\u2019s\nHandbook, Bank Supervision Process; FDIC Risk Management Manual of Examination Policies, Section 4.1\nManagement.\n7 Neither the principles nor this rescission requires or prohibits financial institutions\u2019 consideration of any particular\nrisk or set of risks, nor do they create any rights or obligations for financial institutions.\n-3- A.Executive Order 12866\nPursuant to section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, the Office of Information and\nRegulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that the\nrescission is a \u201csignificant regulatory action.\u201d\nB.Paperwork Reduction Act\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) (PRA) states that no\nagency may conduct or sponsor, nor is the respondent required to respond to, an information\ncollection unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.\nThe rescission does not create any new, or revise any existing, collections of information\nunder the PRA.

Community banks are still expected to follow all laws and regulations applicable to their RNDIP offerings and comply with all pertinent legal requirements. Note for Community Banks This guidance is applicable to all community banks. Highlights Many banks recommend or sell RNDIPs either to retail customers directly or more commonly through arrangements with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. The OCC has published guidance to examiners regarding the examination of bank RNDIP programs in the RNDIP booklet of the Comptroller's Handbook. The RNDIP booklet defines RNDIPs to include any product with an investment component that, in most instances, is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Common RNDIPs include mutual funds, exchange traded funds, variable and fixed rate annuities, equities, and fixed income securities. The RNDIP booklet provides comprehensive guidance for bank examiners on activities involving the recommendation or sale of RNDIPs to retail customers, explains the risks inherent in banks' RNDIP sales programs, and provides a framework for banks to manage those risks. This booklet provides expanded examination procedures for evaluating banks' RNDIP sales activities that supplement the core assessment standards in the \"Large Bank Supervision\" and \"Community Bank Supervision\" booklets of the Comptroller's Handbook. Because of their complexity, the comprehensive exam procedures and risk management practices outlined in the RNDIP booklet are generally unsuitable for community banks. As a result, these procedures and practices impose unnecessary burden. The OCC makes judicious use of its exam resources and prioritizes its examinations around the most salient risks to its banks. Examining community banks according to the expanded procedures in the RNDIP booklet is not a prudent use of OCC examination resources. Community banks tend to have more limited RNDIP offerings. Thus, under the OCC's risk-based examination posture, a simpler examination framework is appropriate for them. Relieving unnecessary examination burden from the RNDIP programs will leave community banks with more resources to focus on material financial risk mitigation. Removing unnecessary impediments to community banks' offering of RNDIP sales programs can promote the competitive viability of community banks and the availability of beneficial financial services to consumers. The OCC will no longer examine community banks' direct or indirect offering of RNDIP products using the standards and procedures in the RNDIP booklet. Instead, OCC examiners will only use the core assessment standards in the \"Community Bank Supervision\" booklet of the Comptroller's Handbook. This change to examination policy is part of the OCC's ongoing efforts to reflect a tailored regulatory framework for bank supervision. Community banks must comply with all laws and regulations applicable to their direct or indirect offering of RNDIP products and activities, including: the Gramm\u00e2\u0080\u0093Leach\u00e2\u0080\u0093Bliley Act, federal securities laws, federal and state insurance laws, consumer privacy laws, Bank Secrecy Act\/anti-money laundering laws, and prudential OCC regulations. The OCC will continue to consider each bank's RNDIP activities on an individual basis and will continue to consider each bank's unique circumstances and risk profile when determining examination priorities for that institution. The OCC will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the procedures and expectations in the RNDIP booklet and will consider making further edits to the booklet in the future consistent with safety and soundness principles to reduce burden for a wider range of banks.

This approach will maintain the value of the federal charter and preserve banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 safety and soundness while ensuring regulatory oversight does not unduly distract banks from serving their communities. The OCC will continue to review its examination processes and will update the relevant booklets of the Comptroller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Handbook and other documents as soon as practicable. Note for Community Banks This guidance is applicable to all community banks. Highlights Effective January 1, 2026, the OCC is eliminating mandatory OCC policy-based examination requirements for community banks to reduce supervisory burden and better align OCC practices with risk-based supervision. Bank examiners will be empowered to tailor examination scope and frequency based on risk-based supervision, consistent with applicable laws and regulations. The OCC is reaffirming the importance of examiners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 relying on quarterly monitoring and existing bank reports. The OCC is also reassessing its data collection requests. Background The OCC recognizes the vital role that community banks serve in meeting the needs of their communities. Most community banks are well capitalized and well managed, conduct business in a safe and sound manner, and engage in low-risk activities. The OCC is required by statute and regulation to conduct a full scope, on site examination of every bank every 12 to 18 months, in what is referred to as the supervisory cycle.2 In implementing this requirement and fulfilling its mission in ensuring the safe and sound operation of banks under its supervision, the OCC has long strived to apply risk-based supervision in its examination of banks of all sizes.3 However, in practice, the OCC has continued to require certain examination activities with predefined scope and frequency set by OCC policy. The OCC is reaffirming its commitment to risk-based supervision, and it will tailor its supervisory activities for community banks to each bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size, complexity, and risk profile. To align with risk-based supervision, effective January 1, 2026, the OCC is removing for community banks all requirements for examination activities set by OCC policy. Instead, in fulfilling its responsibility for conducting a full scope, on-site examination during each supervisory cycle, OCC examiners will tailor their examination of a community bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specific activities in light of its size, complexity, and risk profile, with heightened focus on material financial risks. Examiners will retain their discretion to conduct, as appropriate, supervisory activities beyond those required by statute, consistent with a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size, complexity, risk profile, and the risks posed by the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specific activities. This change will reduce regulatory burden on community banks and simplify requests made by examiners. For example, OCC policy currently requires examiners to perform a fair lending risk assessment during every supervisory cycle and perform transaction testing for flood insurance coverage once during every three supervisory cycles.4 (Refer to the appendix to this bulletin for a table of OCC examination and activities set by policy.) By eliminating these requirements, examiners will no longer be required to collect information or perform these activities. Similarly, in examining a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compliance with flood insurance requirements, examiners will determine whether there is a need to conduct transaction testing based on risk and will not, for example, conduct transaction testing solely for the sake of completing procedures required by OCC policy. When appropriate for a community bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities and risk profile, examiners will conduct appropriate examination activities. This may include streamlined testing methods, more limited sampling, and reliance on bank-provided reports as appropriate for a community bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities and size, complexity, and risk profile. As needed, examiners will also conduct follow up activities for matters requiring attention, violations of law, and enforcement actions at appropriate times. The OCC is also reaffirming the importance of examiners relying on quarterly monitoring activities5 and bank-provided reports. As part of their quarterly monitoring, examiners will conduct off-site analyses focused on essential financial risk indicators. Examiners will discuss with bank management financial trends and changes in bank operations, risk management, and personnel. Examiners will focus on areas of significant actual or planned changes, including growth, to determine whether there are emerging or newly identified risks. Examiners will use this analysis and communication to better focus on actual risks facing the bank and reduce disruption during the required on-site examination. Similarly, examiners will leverage a community bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audit, risk management, reporting and other functions when appropriate. Although examiners will need to determine the reliability of these functions, when reliance is appropriate, examiners will use these bank-provided reports to avoid unnecessary duplication and reduce the burden on banks. The OCC is also reassessing its data-collection activities for community banks. For example, the OCC currently collects information from community banks such as the Money Laundering Risk System and the Interest Rate Risk Survey to assist in scoping examinations. The OCC is assessing its use of these tools and whether the data collected are necessary or could be collected in a less burdensome manner. The OCC will continue to review its processes to identify additional opportunities to gain efficiencies and provide relief from regulatory burden. The OCC will communicate any further changes and update the booklets of the Comptroller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Handbook and other documents as applicable.

Concurrently, the OCC has instructed its examiners that they should no longer examine for disparate impact. Note for Community Banks The OCC's discontinuation of examining for disparate impact applies to community banks. Highlights On April 23, 2025, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 14281, Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy. EO 14281 directs agencies to eliminate the use of disparate impact liability in all contexts. Consistent with EO 14281, the OCC supervisory process for fair lending compliance no longer includes examining for disparate impact liability. Examiners will not request, review, or conclude on or follow-up on matters related to a bank's disparate impact risk, internal disparate-impact risk analysis, or disparate-impact risk assessment processes or procedures. The OCC's supervisory processes continue to include regularly conducting fair lending risk assessments, analyzing Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data for possible evidence of disparate treatment, conducting risk-based fair lending examinations, and taking appropriate action if evidence of disparate treatment is found. The OCC expects banks to provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-4 | January 14, 2025 Federal and State Financial Regulatory Agencies Issue Interagency Statement on Supervisory Practices Regarding Financial Institutions Affected by the California Wildfires and Straight-line Winds Share This Page: Joint Release California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Reserve Board National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of the California wildfires and straight-line winds on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found at https:\/\/www.fema.gov\/disaster\/declarations. Lending: The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty should be accounted for as a new loan or a continuance of an existing loan. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and appropriately report the modification in the institution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call report. In supervising institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by the California wildfires and straight-line winds may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reporting requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https:\/\/www.ffiec.gov\/cra\/qnadoc.htm. Investments: Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.

    "cleaned_text":"Findings from Analysis of Nationwide Summary Statistics for 2024\nCommunity Reinvestment Act Data Fact Sheet\nThis analysis is based on 2024 data compiled by the three Federal banking agency\nmembers of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) with\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA) responsibilities \u2014 the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This analysis was conducted using data\ncompiled for financial institutions reporting under the CRA regulations.\nBackground\nThe CRA1 was enacted by Congress in 1977 and is designed to encourage regulated\nfinancial institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they\nare chartered, consistent with safe and sound operations. Depository institutions with total\nassets that meet a certain threshold are required to collect and report data regarding their\nsmall business, small farm, and community development lending. The mandatory reporting\nthreshold adjusts annually based on changes to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage\nEarners and Clerical Workers and for 2024 was $1.564 billion.2\nThe small business and small farm lending data reported under the CRA regulations\nprovide useful information about such lending, but they are less comprehensive than the\ndata reported on home mortgage lending under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. For\nexample, the CRA data:\n\u2022 include information on loans originated or purchased, but not on applications for\nloans that were not originated;\n\u2022 indicate whether a loan is extended to a borrower with annual revenues of $1\nmillion or less, but the data do not identify a borrower\u2019s annual revenues with any\ngreater precision, nor do they include demographic information about borrower(s);\nand\n\u2022 are aggregated into three categories based on loan size and reported at the census\ntract level, rather than loan-by-loan.\nCertain considerations should be taken into account when reviewing and interpreting the\nCRA data. For example, depository institutions are asked to report the geographic location\nof the loan. If the proceeds of a small business loan are used in more than one location, the\ninstitution can record the loan location as either the address of the borrower\u2019s business\nheadquarters or the location where the greatest portion of the proceeds are applied, as\n1 12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq. The CRA is implemented by the OCC in 12 CFR part 25, the Board in 12 CFR part 228\n(Regulation BB), and the FDIC in 12 CFR part 345.\n2 https:\/\/www.ffiec.gov\/data\/cra\/reporting-criteria. indicated by the borrower. However, these locations may have different socioeconomic\ncharacteristics.\nFurther, although the CRA data provide information on extensions of credit in a geographic\narea, they do not indicate the amount or nature of the overall demand for credit in that\narea. Consequently, caution should be used in drawing conclusions from analyses using\nonly CRA data, as differences in loan volume across areas may reflect differences in local\ndemand for credit. Indeed, CRA performance assessments by the supervisory agencies\nfocus on evaluating the volume and distribution of lending in the context of local credit\nneeds.\nFinally, the CRA small business and small farm lending data reported each year cover only a\nportion of the credit extended to small businesses and small farms. Depository institutions\nthat do not report CRA data and nonbank financial institutions not covered by the CRA,\nsuch as commercial finance companies, also extend such loans.\nGeneral Description of the 2024 CRA Small Business and Small Farm Loan Data\nFor 2024, a total of 731 lenders reported data about originations and purchases of small\nloans to businesses and farms (loans with original amounts of $1 million or less for small\nbusiness or $500k for small farm), representing a 1.4 percent increase from the 721\nlenders reporting data for 2023 (see Table 1).3 Of the 731 institutions reporting 2024 data,\n61 had assets below the mandatory reporting threshold and reported either voluntarily or\nbecause they elected to be evaluated as a \u201clarge\u201d institution during CRA examinations (see\nTable 3).\nSmall business and small farm lending reported in the CRA data covers a significant share\nof all small business and small farm lending by depository institutions. Analysis of data\nfrom Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income submitted by depository institutions\nindicates that CRA reporters account for 77.6 percent of small business loans outstanding\n(by dollar amount) and 36.1 percent of small farm loans outstanding (by dollar amount) at\ndepository institutions (see Table 1). Larger institutions account for most of the reported\nlending. During 2024, financial institutions with assets of $1.564 billion or more (as of\nDecember 31, 2023) accounted for 99.9 percent of reported small business loan\noriginations (99.4 percent by dollar amount) (see Table 3). The very largest institutions \u2013\n157 reporters with assets of $10 billion or more \u2013 accounted for about 88.3 percent of the\n3 For the purposes of this table, reporters with assets of less than $250 million are categorized as \u2018small\u2019;\nreporters with assets at or above the CRA reporting asset threshold for the given year (see\n[https:\/\/www.ffiec.gov\/data\/cra\/reporting-criteria]) are categorized as \u2018large\u2019; and the remainder of\nreporting institutions are categorized as \u2018medium\u2019. As a consequence of amendments to the CRA regulations,\nbeginning in September 2005, banking institutions with assets below the mandatory reporting threshold\n(and, beginning in October 2004, savings associations with assets below that threshold) are not required to\ncollect or report data on their small business or small farm lending. However, institutions with assets below\nthe mandatory reporting threshold may voluntarily collect and report such information. In addition,\ndepository institutions must report the information if they elect to be evaluated as \u201clarge\u201d institutions during\nCRA examinations. number of CRA reported small business loans originated in 2024 (70.7 percent by dollar\namount) (not shown in tables).\nIn the aggregate, about 9.1 million small business loans (originations and purchases)\ntotaling nearly $276.6 billion were reported in 2024 (see Table 1). The share of\noriginations by dollar amount was 93.2 percent (95.9 percent by count), and the share of\npurchases was 6.8 percent (4.1 percent by count). The total number of loans (including\npurchases) increased by 8.1 percent, while the number of loans originated increased by 8.3\npercent relative to 2023. The dollar amount of small business loans originated increased by\n6.2 percent.\nRegarding small farm loans, about 197 thousand small farm loans (originations and\npurchases) were reported for 2024, totaling about $14.5 billion, an increase of about 0.5\npercent in the number of loans and 4.0 percent in the dollar amount of loans in 2024 from\n2023.\nThe CRA data provide information about the size of small business and small farm loans.\nFor small business loans, the maximum loan size reported is $1 million; for small farm\nloans, the maximum is $500,000. Measured by number of loan originations, 95 percent of\nthe small business loans and 79.1 percent of the small farm loans originated in 2024 were\nfor amounts under $100,000 (see Table 2). The distribution differs for the dollar amount of\nloans originated; 44.5 percent of the small business loan dollars and 27.5 percent of the\nsmall farm loan dollars were extended through loans of less than $100,000 (see Table 2).\nLoans to Smaller Businesses and Farms\nThe CRA data include information about loans to businesses or farms with revenues of $1\nmillion or less. Overall, 53.8 percent of the number of reported small business loan\noriginations (34.6 percent measured by dollar amount of loans) and 57.9 percent of the\nnumber of reported small farm loan originations (60.3 percent measured by dollar amount\nof loans) were extended to firms with revenues of $1 million or less (see Table 2).\nThe Geographic Distribution of Small Business and Small Farm Lending\nCRA performance assessments include an analysis of the distribution of small business and\nsmall farm loans (of all types) across census tracts grouped into four relative income\ncategories: low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income.4 Overall, the distribution of the\nnumber (see Table 4.1) and the dollar amounts (see Table 4.2) of small business loans\nacross these categories partly reflects the distribution of population and businesses across\n4 For purposes of the regulations, a low-income census tract has a median family income that is less than 50\npercent of the median family income for the broader area (the metropolitan area or metropolitan division, as\nappropriate, containing the tract or the entire non-metropolitan area of the state); a moderate-income census\ntract, 50 percent to less than 80 percent; a middle-income census tract, 80 percent to less than 120 percent;\nand an upper-income census tract, 120 percent or more. Data regarding census tract income categories are\nderived from the 2016-2020 American Community Survey. For more information refer to\nhttp:\/\/www.census.gov\/acs\/. these four income groups, although lending activity in upper-income areas exceeds the\nshare of businesses and population in such areas.5 For example, low-income census tracts\ninclude 5.7 and 4.6 percent of the population and businesses respectively, and accounted\nfor 4.1 percent of the number and 4.5 percent of the total dollar amount of small business\nloans in 2024.6 Upper-income census tracts include 29.3 percent of the population and 34.7\npercent of the businesses, and had about 39.3 percent of the number and 37.7 percent of\nthe total dollar amount of small business loans in 2024. The share of reported loans (by\ncount) going to low- and moderate-income tracts has remained relatively consistent over\nrecent years, between about 22 and 23 percent.\nAnalysis of the CRA data shows that small business loans are heavily concentrated in\nmetropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), as are the bulk of the U.S. population and businesses\n(see Table 4.1 and Table 4.2). The majority of small farm loans were extended to farms\nlocated in non-MSA areas (see Table 4.3 and Table 4.4).\nCommunity Development Lending\nInstitutions reporting CRA data also report the number and dollar amount of their\ncommunity development loans. Among the 731 institutions reporting for 2024, 646\ninstitutions reported community development lending activity (see Table 5). As in previous\nyears, in 2024 lenders with assets that met or exceeded the mandatory reporting threshold\n($1.564 billion in 2024) extended the vast majority of reported community development\nloans. Overall, lenders reported a combined total of over $138 billion in community\ndevelopment loans in 2024, a 9 percent increase from the amount reported in 2023.\n5 Beginning in 1998, institutions filing CRA data were allowed to report that the census tract location of a firm\nor farm receiving a loan was unknown. For 2024, about 1.3 percent of the reported number of small business\nloans and 1.9 percent of the amount included such a designation.\n6 Data on the share of population across census tract income categories are derived from the 2016-2020\nAmerican Community Survey. Data on the share of businesses across census tract income categories are\nderived from information from Dun and Bradstreet files of businesses. Calculations exclude agricultural-\nrelated firms.",

Gould issued the following statement today following the Federal Reserve Board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment on its stress test models, changes to the framework that guides the design of the hypothetical scenarios, and other elements of the stress test process: The OCC commends Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership and the Federal Reserve Board for its recent action to promote transparency and improve accountability around its annual stress tests. The stress testing regime established after the Global Financial Crisis has been too complex and opaque. The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action is an important step toward restoring public trust, better aligning with the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act, and moving toward a holistic public understanding of the post-Global Financial Crisis capital framework. The OCC also is committed to regulatory transparency, clarity, and improved accountability, and is working to ensure these principles are foundational to its approach to the supervision and regulation of the federal banking system.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-104 | October 27, 2025 OCC Requests Comments on Proposed Rescission of Its Recovery Planning Guidelines Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today requested comment on a proposal to rescind its recovery planning guidelines for certain large insured national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches (banks). Under the proposal, the recovery planning guidelines that went into effect January 1, 2025, and applied to banks with at least $100 billion in assets would be rescinded. The OCC expects the institutions it supervises to be well managed and have appropriate risk management processes in place to prepare for and respond to stress. Risk management is a dynamic process that involves real-time responses to the facts and circumstances of a stress event or periods of stress. Banks should routinely assess and adjust their operations to adapt to evolving risk factors and conditions. Relieving covered banks of the obligation to engage in prescriptive recovery planning activities is consistent with the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing effort to identify and eliminate unnecessary regulatory burden.

Background\nOn September 29, 2016, the OCC issued Guidelines Establishing Standards for\nRecovery Planning by Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings\nAssociations, and Insured Federal Branches (Guidelines).1 Under the Guidelines, an\ninsured national bank, insured Federal savings association, or insured Federal branch\n1 81 FR 66791 (Sept. 29, 2016). The Guidelines are codified at 12 CFR part 30, appendix E. They were\nissued pursuant to section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, which authorizes\nthe OCC to prescribe enforceable safety and soundness standards. subject to the standards (covered banks) should have a recovery plan that includes (1)\nquantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that reflect its\nparticular vulnerabilities; (2) a wide range of credible options that it could undertake in\nresponse to the stress to restore its financial strength and viability; and (3) an assessment\nand description of how these options would affect it. The Guidelines provide that a\nrecovery plan should also address (1) the covered bank\u2019s overall organizational and legal\nentity structure and its interconnections and interdependencies; (2) procedures for\nescalating decision-making to senior management or the board of directors or an\nappropriate committee thereof (board); (3) management reports; (4) communication\nprocedures; and (5) any other information the OCC communicates in writing. The\nGuidelines also set forth the responsibilities of management and the board with respect to\nthe covered bank\u2019s recovery plan.\nThe 2016 Guidelines applied to banks with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or\nmore. In 2018, the OCC amended the Guidelines to raise the threshold to $250 billion\nbased on its view, at that time, that these larger, more complex, and potentially more\ninterconnected banks presented greater systemic risk to the financial system and would\nbenefit most from recovery planning.2\nIn October 2024, the OCC amended the Guidelines to apply to banks with average\ntotal consolidated assets of $100 billion or more; incorporate a testing standard; and\nclarify the role of non-financial (including operational and strategic) risk in recovery\nplanning.3\nII. Recission of Guidelines\n2 83 FR 66604 (Dec. 27, 2018).\n3 89 FR 84255 (Oct. 22, 2024). As a part of the ongoing assessment of the agency\u2019s supervisory framework to\nidentify and eliminate unnecessary regulatory burden, the OCC is proposing to amend 12\nCFR part 30 by rescinding the Guidelines contained in appendix E. The Guidelines cause\ncovered banks to direct significant resources towards developing responsive\ndocumentation. In the OCC\u2019s experience, much of this documentation is, by its nature,\nscenario-dependent or otherwise conjectural and, therefore, is likely to be irrelevant or of\nlimited utility when a covered bank faces stress. Appropriate recovery options and\ncommunication procedures, for example, may vary widely depending on the facts and\ncircumstances of the particular stress scenario, including many that would be outside of\nthe covered banks\u2019 control or ability to reliably predict. Likewise, impact assessments\nfor such recovery options appear conjectural by nature and of limited utility in an actual\nstress scenario.\nThe OCC has also observed that covered banks are well attuned to indicia of stress\nwithout regard to the presence of the recovery planning triggers and escalation procedure\nexpectations of the Guidelines. Moreover, the OCC is concerned that escalation or\ncommunication procedures or other actions tied to such triggers may be unnecessary or\ninappropriate under the particular facts and circumstances of a stress scenario.\nMore generally, the OCC believes that proper risk management should be a dynamic\nprocess that involves real-time responses to the facts and circumstances of a stress event\nor periods of stress. As such, the OCC would not necessarily expect adherence to\nrecovery plans. Rather, the OCC would expect to closely monitor a covered bank as it\nassesses and responds to a stress event.4 Banks are in the business of risk management\n4 Although the OCC does not intend to discourage covered banks from developing plans to address stress\nscenarios, the OCC does not expect to require or review the appropriateness of such plans, nor does it and are constantly assessing and adjusting their operations to adapt to evolving risk\nfactors and conditions. Relieving covered banks of the obligation to engage in\nprescriptive recovery planning activities will further restore the risk management function\nto bank management\u2019s control and enhances resource availability that can be directed\ntowards improving risk management operations and other productive activities.\nFurther, the OCC\u2019s existing safety and soundness standards require all insured\ndepository institutions to have effective risk management processes, including in times of\nstress, that is commensurate with the size, complexity, and risk of their activities.5 In\naddition, the OCC expects financial institutions of all sizes to consider and appropriately\naddress all material risks in their operating environment and be resilient to a range of\nrisks.6 Further, the OCC expects that all institutions have a formal contingency funding\nplan that considers a range of possible stress scenarios, assesses the stability of funding\nduring periods of stress, and provides for a broad range of funding sources under adverse\nconditions.7 The duplication of these principles in the Guidelines can be eliminated\nwithout undermining the structural integrity of prudential regulation of covered banks.\nexpect for the covered bank to adhere to such plan unless it is the most consistent with the bank\u2019s safe and\nsound operations under the circumstances.\n5 Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1 requires the OCC to prescribe safety\nand soundness standards for insured depository institutions. Such standards were implemented by rule in\n12 CFR part 30, appendix A. These guidelines address, among other things, operational and managerial\nstandards relating to (1) internal controls, information systems; (2) internal audit systems; (3) loan\ndocumentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; (6) asset growth; (7) asset quality;\n(8) earnings; and (9) compensation.\n6 See, e.g., the Bank Supervision Process booklet of the Comptroller\u2019s Handbook,\nhttps:\/\/www.occ.gov\/publications-and-resources\/publications\/comptrollers-handbook\/files\/bank-\nsupervision-process\/index-bank-supervision-process.html.\n7 See Addendum to the Interagency Policy Statement on Funding and Liquidity Risk Management:\nImportance of Contingency Funding Plans, OCC Bulletin 2023-25, which can be accessed here:\nhttps:\/\/www.occ.gov\/news-issuances\/news-releases\/2023\/nr-ia-2023-82a.pdf; see also Interagency Policy\nStatement on Funding and Liquidity Risk Management, Federal Reserve SR 10-6 (March 17, 2010), FDIC\nFIL-13-2010 (April 10, 2010), and OCC Bulletin 2010-13 (March 22, 2010). These individual agency\nissuances released the 2010 Interagency Policy Statement on Funding and Liquidity Risk Management,\nwhich can be accessed here: https:\/\/www.govinfo.gov\/content\/pkg\/FR-2010-03-22\/pdf\/2010-6137.pdf. Finally, unlike statutorily mandated resolution planning,8 there is no statutory\nrequirement that covered banks undertake recovery planning. Rather, the Guidelines\nimpose an unnecessary regulatory burden on covered banks that consumes valuable\nresources and fails to account for management\u2019s ability to assess and manage risks prior\nto and during periods of stress. Therefore, the OCC is proposing to amend 12 CFR part\n30 by rescinding the Guidelines contained in appendix E.\nIII. REQUEST FOR FEEDBACK\nQuestion 1. Should the OCC codify the contingency funding plan expectations set forth\nin the Interagency Policy Statement on Funding and Liquidity Risk Management and the\nAddendum to the Interagency Policy Statement on Funding and Liquidity Risk\nManagement: Importance of Contingency Funding Plans? If so, should the codified\ncontingency funding plan requirements apply to all OCC-regulated institutions or a\nsubset of regulated entities?9\nIV. Request for Comment\nThe OCC encourages comment on any aspect of this proposal and especially on the\nspecific issues discussed in this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section.\nV. Regulatory Analysis\nPaperwork Reduction Act\nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA),10 the OCC may not conduct\nor sponsor, and a respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection\nunless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control\n8 See 12 U.S.C. 5365.\n9 See supra note 7.\n10 44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq. number. The OCC has reviewed the notice of proposed rulemaking and determined that\nit would not create any new or revise any existing, collections of information under the\nPRA and therefore, require no PRA filings, other than a discontinuance request to OMB\nfor the currently approved \u201cGuidelines Establishing Standards for Recovery Planning by\nCertain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations, and Insured\nFederal Branches (1557-0333)\u201d information collection following the finalization of the\nrule.\nTitle of Information Collection: OCC Guidelines Establishing Standards\nfor Recovery Planning by Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal\nSavings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches.\nOMB Control Number: 1557-0333.\nAffected Public: Businesses or other for-profit organizations.\nDescription: Twelve CFR part 30, appendix E, current Guidelines apply to\nnational banks, insured Federal savings associations, and insured Federal\nbranches of foreign banks with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more.\nThe OMB previously approved the collection of information in the current\nGuidelines, which are found at paragraphs II.B., II.C., and III. Specifically,\nparagraph II.B. lists the elements of the recovery plan, which are an overview of\nthe covered bank; triggers; options for recovery; impact assessments; escalation\nprocedures; management reports; communication procedures; and other\ninformation. Paragraph II.C. addresses the relationship of the plan to other\ncovered bank processes and coordination with other plans, including the processes\nand plans of its bank holding company. Paragraph III. outlines management and the board\u2019s responsibilities. The Guidelines also include a testing standard, which\nprovides that a covered bank should test its recovery plan.\nAdditionally, the Guidelines clarify the role of non-financial risk\n(including operational and strategic risk) in recovery planning.\nCurrent Burden\nFrequency of Response: On occasion.\nTotal Number of Respondents: 21.\nTotal Burden per Respondent: 32,017 hours.\nTotal Burden for Collection: 672,360 hours.\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires an agency, in\nconnection with a proposed rule, to prepare an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\ndescribing the impact of the rule on small entities (defined by the Small Business\nAdministration (SBA) for purposes of the RFA to include commercial banks and savings\ninstitutions with total assets of $850 million or less and trust companies with total assets\nof $47 million or less) or to certify that the proposed rule would not have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. However, under section\n605(b) of the RFA, this analysis is not required if an agency certifies that the rule would\nnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and\npublishes its certification and a short explanatory statement in the Federal Register along\nwith its rule.\nThe OCC certifies that the proposed recission of part 30, appendix E, if adopted,\nwill not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Twelve CFR\npart 30, appendix E currently applies to only those insured national bank, insured Federal savings association, or insured Federal branch with average total consolidated assets of\n$100 billion or more. Therefore, the recission of appendix E would impact no small\nentities supervised by the OCC. Accordingly, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is\nnot required.\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\nThe OCC analyzed the proposed rule under the factors set forth in the Unfunded\nMandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (2 U.S.C. 1532). Under this analysis, the OCC\nconsidered whether the proposed rule includes a Federal mandate that may result in the\nexpenditure by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private\nsector, of $100 million or more (currently $187 million, as adjusted annually for\ninflation) in any one year. The OCC has determined that the cost savings associated with\nthe rescission of the Guidelines\u2019 mandates will be approximately $20 million. Therefore,\nthe OCC concludes that the recission of 12 CFR part 30, appendix E, will not result in an\nexpenditure of $187 million or more annually by State, local, and Tribal governments, in\nthe aggregate, or by the private sector.\nRiegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994\nPursuant to section 302(a) of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory\nImprovement Act of 1994,11 in determining the effective date and administrative\ncompliance requirements for new regulations that impose additional reporting, disclosure,\nor other requirements on insured depository institutions, the OCC must consider,\nconsistent with the principles of safety and soundness and the public interest: (1) any\nadministrative burdens that the proposed rule would place on depository institutions,\n11 12 U.S.C. 4802(a). including small depository institutions, and customers of depository institutions and (2)\nthe benefits of the proposed rule. This rulemaking would not impose additional\nreporting, disclosure, or other requirements on insured depository institutions. Therefore,\nsection 302(a) of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act\nof 1994 does not apply to this rulemaking.\nProviding Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023\nThe Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act of 202312 requires that a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking include the internet address of a summary of not more\nthan 100 words in length of a proposed rule, in plain language, that shall be posted on the\ninternet website www.regulations.gov.\nThe proposed rulemaking would rescind the OCC\u2019s Guidelines Establishing\nStandards for Recovery Planning by Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured\nFederal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches contained in appendix E of\n12 CFR part 30.\nThe proposal and the required summary can be found at\nhttps:\/\/www.regulations.gov by searching for Docket ID OCC-2025-0339 and\nhttps:\/\/occ.gov\/topics\/laws-and-regulations\/occ-regulations\/proposed-issuances\/index-\nproposed-issuances.html.\nExecutive Orders 12866 and 14192\nExecutive Order 12866, titled \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review,\u201d as amended,\nprovides that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), will review all\n12 12 U.S.C. 553(b)(4). \u201csignificant regulatory actions\u201d as defined therein. OIRA has determined that this\nproposal is not a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d for purposes of Executive Order 12866.\nExecutive Order 14192, titled \u2018\u2018Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,\u201d\nseparately requires that an agency, unless prohibited by law, identify at least 10 existing\nregulations to be repealed when the agency publicly proposes for notice and comment or\notherwise promulgates a new regulation with total costs greater than zero. Executive\nOrder 14192 further requires that new incremental costs associated with new regulations\nshall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs\nassociated with at least ten prior regulations. The OCC expects the proposed rule will be\na deregulatory action under Executive Order 14192.\nList of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 30\nAdministrative practice and procedure, National banks, Reporting and recordkeeping\nrequirements.\nPART 30\u2014SAFETYAND SOUNDNESS STANDARDS\nAPPENDIX E TO PART 30 [REMOVED]\nFor the reasons stated in the preamble, and under the authority of 12 U.S.C. 93a and\n12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency proposes to remove\nAppendix E to part 30.\nJonathan V.

The agencies do not believe principles for managing climate-related financial risk are necessary because the agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 existing safety and soundness standards require all supervised institutions to have effective risk management commensurate with their size, complexity, and activities. In addition, all supervised institutions are expected to consider and appropriately address all material financial risks and should be resilient to a range of risks, including emerging risks. The interagency principles were previously issued jointly by the agencies in October 2023. The notice, which will be issued in the Federal Register, rescinds these principles effective immediately. The OCC withdrew its participation in the principles earlier this year.

Background\nOn October 30, 2023, after issuing separate requests for comment,1 the agencies jointly\nissued Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management (principles).2 These\n1 OCC Bulletin 2021-62, Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large\nBanks; Request for Feedback, (December 16, 2021); FDIC, Request for Comment on a Statement of Principles for\nClimate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, 87 FR 19507 (April 4, 2022); Board,\nPrinciples for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, 87 FR 75267\n(December 8, 2022).\n2 88 FR 74183 (October 30, 2023).\n-2- principles were intended for financial institutions3 with over $100 billion in total consolidated\nassets. On March 31, 2025, the OCC withdrew its participation in the principles.4\nII. Rescission of Guidance\nThe agencies\u2019 existing safety and soundness standards require all insured depository\ninstitutions to have effective risk management processes commensurate with the size, complexity\nand risk of their activities.5 In addition, financial institutions of all sizes are expected to consider\nand appropriately address all material risks in their operating environment and should be resilient\nto a range of risks, including emerging risks.6 The agencies do not believe principles for the\nmanagement of climate-related financial risk are necessary and are concerned that such\nprinciples could distract from the management of other potential risks identified and addressed\nby financial institutions\u2019 existing risk management processes and the agencies\u2019 other risk\nmanagement rules and guidance. 7 Therefore, the principles are rescinded.\nIII.Administrative Law Matters\n3 In this issuance, the term \u201cfinancial institution\u201d or \u201cinstitution\u201d includes national banks, Federal savings\nassociations, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, state nonmember banks, state savings associations, state\nmember banks, bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, intermediate holding companies,\nforeign banking organizations with respect to their U.S. operations, and non-bank systemically important financial\ninstitutions (SIFIs) supervised by the Board.\n4 OCC Withdraws Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, News\nRelease 2025-27 (March 31, 2025).\n5 Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, requires the FDIC, Board, and OCC to\nprescribe safety and soundness standards for insured depository institutions. Such standards were implemented by\nrule in 12 CFR part 364, appendix A (FDIC), 12 CFR part 208, appendix D-1 (Board), and 12 CFR part 30,\nappendix A (OCC). These guidelines address, among other things, operational and managerial standards relating to\n(1)internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit\nunderwriting; and (4) interest rate risk exposure.\n6 See, e.g., SR Letter 95-51 (as revised June 23, 2025); SR Letter 21-3 (February 26, 2021); OCC Comptroller\u2019s\nHandbook, Bank Supervision Process; FDIC Risk Management Manual of Examination Policies, Section 4.1\nManagement.\n7 Neither the principles nor this rescission requires or prohibits financial institutions\u2019 consideration of any particular\nrisk or set of risks, nor do they create any rights or obligations for financial institutions.\n-3- A.Executive Order 12866\nPursuant to section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, the Office of Information and\nRegulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that the\nrescission is a \u201csignificant regulatory action.\u201d\nB.Paperwork Reduction Act\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) (PRA) states that no\nagency may conduct or sponsor, nor is the respondent required to respond to, an information\ncollection unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.\nThe rescission does not create any new, or revise any existing, collections of information\nunder the PRA. Therefore, no information collection request will be submitted to the OMB for\nreview.\nJonathan V. Gould,\nComptroller of the Currency.\nBy order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nBenjamin W. McDonough,\nDeputy Secretary of the Board.\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nBy order of the Board of Directors.\nDated at Washington, DC on September 25, 2025.\nJennifer M.

The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Formal Agreement with First National Bank of Pasco, Dade City, Florida, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to board oversight and corporate governance, strategic and capital planning, Bank Secrecy Act\/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA\/AML) risk management and suspicious activity reporting, and violations of law, rule, or regulation, including those related to Suspicious Activity Reports and Due Diligence Programs for Correspondent Accounts for Foreign Financial Institutions. (Docket No. AA-SO-2025-46) The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs: The OCC does not have any enforcement actions against IAPs to release in October. The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d into a new action. Termination actions include: Order Terminating the Formal Agreement with B2 Bank National Association, Mountain Iron, Minnesota, dated November 14, 2023 (Docket No. AA-CE-2023-36). The Formal Agreement addressed unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to internal controls and less than satisfactory management. (Docket No. AA-CE-2025-48) Orders Terminating the Formal Agreements with California International Bank, A National Banking Association, Westminster, California, dated February 23, 2021 (AA-WE-2021-7) and June 20, 2023 (AA-WE-2023-25). The Formal Agreements addressed unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to deficient earnings, less than satisfactory liquidity and capital, and strategic plan execution, and violations of law, rule, or regulation, including those relating to BSA compliance. (Docket No. AA-WE-2025-52 and Docket No. AA-WE-2025-53) Order Terminating the Formal Agreement with The National Iron Bank, Salisbury, Connecticut, dated July 11, 2023 (Docket No. AA-NE-2023-24). The Formal Agreement addressed unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to capital and strategic planning, concentrations risk management, credit underwriting and administration, and BSA\/AML risk management, and violations of law, rule, or regulation, including those relating to compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-101 | October 15, 2025 OCC Announces Conditional Approval for Chartering Erebor Bank Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced today that it has conditionally approved the de novo national bank charter application for Erebor Bank, National Association, Columbus, Ohio. The OCC granted preliminary conditional approval to Erebor Bank after thorough review of its application. In granting this charter, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards applied to all charter applications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cErebor is the first de novo bank to receive a preliminary conditional approval since I arrived at the OCC. I am committed to a dynamic and diverse federal banking system, and our decision today is a first but important step in living up to that commitment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision is also proof that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities. Permissible digital asset activities, like any other legally permissible banking activity, have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner. The OCC will continue to provide a path for innovative approaches to financial services to ensure a strong, diverse financial system that remains relevant over time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The federal banking system includes more than 1,000 national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the United States that range in size from 1,000 smaller community banks under $30 billion in assets focused on meeting local needs to the largest internationally active banks. These banking companies conduct a wide array of businesses that range from retail and wholesale banking activity to trust, credit card and other more narrowly focused services. The institutions that make up the federal banking system conduct approximately 67 percent of the banking activity in the United States, hold more than $16 trillion in assets combined and manage more than $85 trillion under their custody and fiduciary control.

    "cleaned_text":"Chartering, Organization and Structure\nOctober 15, 2025\nWendy M. Goldberg, Counsel\nSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\nOne Manhattan West\nNew York, NY 10001\nRe: Application to Charter Erebor Bank, National Association, Columbus, Ohio (Proposed),\nOCC Control No. 2025-Charter-342076, Proposed Charter No. 25357\nApplication for Residency Waivers, OCC Control No. 2025-Waiver-342510\nDear Ms. Goldberg:\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has reviewed your application to establish\na new national bank with the title of Erebor Bank, National Association (proposed Bank). The\nOCC hereby grants preliminary conditional approval of your charter application upon\ndetermining that your proposal meets certain regulatory and policy requirements. Your request\nfor residency waivers is also conditionally approved.\nThis preliminary conditional approval is granted based on a thorough evaluation of all\ninformation available to the OCC, including the representations and commitments made in the\napplication and by the Bank\u2019s representatives. We also made our decision to grant preliminary\nconditional approval with the understanding that the proposed Bank will apply for stock in a\nFederal Reserve Bank in accordance with 12 USC 2221 and will obtain deposit insurance from\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nThe OCC has granted preliminary conditional approval only. Final approval and authorization\nfor the Bank to open will not be granted until all preopening requirements are met. Until final\napproval is granted, the OCC has the right to modify, suspend or rescind this preliminary\nconditional approval should the OCC deem any interim development to warrant such action.\nProposed Bank\nDirectors and controlling shareholders of Erebor Group, Inc. (EGI), a Delaware corporation,\nacting as the organizing group,2 submitted an application to the OCC, pursuant to 12 USC 21\nthrough 27 and 12 CFR 5.20 to establish a full-service national bank.\n1 See also 12 CFR 209.2.\n2 An organizing group consists of five or more natural persons acting on their own behalf, or serving as\nrepresentatives of a sponsoring holding company, who apply to the OCC for a national bank or Federal savings\nassociation charter. See 12 CFR 5.20(d)(8). The organizers are identified below. The Bank will be a full service insured national bank that plans to target its products and services\nto technology companies and ultra-high-net-worth individuals that utilize virtual currencies. The\nBank plans to offer a variety of lending and deposit products and other related services. The\nBank plans to hold non-asset backed virtual currencies on balance sheet to pay transaction fees\n(commonly referred to as \u201cgas fees\u201d) pursuant to 12 USC 24(Seventh). Twelve USC\n24(Seventh) provides that national banks have the power \u201c[t]o exercise\u2026all such incidental\npowers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking\u2026 .\u201d Under 12 CFR\n7.1000(d)(1), \u201c[a]n activity is authorized for a national bank as incidental to the business of\nbanking if it is convenient or useful to an activity that is specifically authorized for national\nbanks or to an activity that is otherwise part of the business of banking.\u201d Holding limited\namounts of crypto-assets as principal to pay gas fees3 is convenient or useful to a bank\u2019s\npermissible crypto-asset custody services.4 Thus, such activity is permissible as incidental to the\nbusiness of banking.5\nMerger\nEGI intends to merge with and into the Bank (Merger) during the in-organization phase of the\nBank under 12 USC 215a-3 and 12 CFR 5.33(g)(4). A merger between affiliates, including a\nmerger under 12 USC 215a-3, is considered a purchase of assets by a bank from an affiliate, and\na covered transaction, for purposes of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act6 and 12 CFR 223\n(collectively, Regulation W).7 Twelve CFR 223.42(i) provides an exemption from Regulation W\nfor the purchase of assets from an affiliate by a newly formed bank if the appropriate Federal\nbanking agency approves the asset purchase in writing in connection with its review of the\nformation of the bank.8 In reviewing the Bank\u2019s application, and consistent with the factors for\napproval of the Merger outlined below and the purpose of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve\n3 EGI projects that the Bank would hold an average of $1 million in gas fee related virtual currencies on balance\nsheet during the Bank\u2019s first three years of operation.\n4 See, e.g., OCC, Interpretive Letter 1170 (July 20, 2020) (IL 1170) (affirming that banks may provide crypto-asset\ncustody services, which may include services such as facilitating the customer\u2019s cryptocurrency and fiat currency\nexchange transactions, transaction settlement, trade execution, [recordkeeping], valuation, tax services, reporting, or\nother appropriate services); Interpretive Letter 1174 (Jan. 4, 2021) (IL 1174) (affirming that banks may act as nodes\non a DLT network to verify customer payments and engage in certain stablecoin activities to facilitate payment\ntransactions on a DLT network); and Interpretive Letter 1184 (May 7, 2025) (IL 1184) (affirming that banks may\nbuy and sell assets held in custody at the custody customer\u2019s direction and may outsource bank-permissible crypto-\nasset activities, including custody and execution services to third parties, subject to appropriate third-party risk\nmanagement practices). Holding limited amounts of crypto-assets would \u201cfacilitate[] the production or delivery of a\nbank's products or services, enhance[] the bank's ability to sell or market its products or services, or improve[] the\neffectiveness or efficiency of the bank's operations, in light of risks presented, innovations, strategies, techniques\nand new technologies for producing and delivering financial products and services.\u201d 12 CFR 7.1000(d).\n5 As it is not necessary to determine for purposes of the OCC\u2019s actions herein, the OCC did not analyze whether\nholding non-asset backed virtual currencies on balance sheet to pay transaction fees is also part of the business of\nbanking.\n6 12 USC 371c.\n7 See 12 CFR 223.3(dd) (defining purchase of asset).\n8 See 12 CFR 223.42(i) (exempting new bank transactions from the qualitative limits, collateral requirements, and\nlow-quality asset prohibitions of Section 23A); 12 CFR 223.52(a)(1) (exempting new bank transactions from the\nmarket terms requirements of Section 23B). The transaction remains subject to Regulation W\u2019s safety and soundness\nrequirement, set forth in 12 CFR 223.13.\n2 Act,9 the OCC is approving EGI\u2019s merger with and into the Bank, and approves the asset\npurchase, as exempt from Regulation W under 12 CFR 223.42(i).\nPrior to consummation of the Merger, the Bank and EGI must ensure they respectively comply\nwith all requirements and procedures to consummate the Merger under 12 USC 215a-3 and 12\nCFR 5.33(g)(4), as applicable. The OCC regulations governing mergers and other business\ncombinations generally set out policy considerations applicable whenever the OCC evaluates any\nbusiness combination. These considerations are: the capital level of any resulting national bank,\nthe conformity of the transaction to applicable law, regulation, and supervisory policies, the\npurpose of the transaction, the impact of the transaction on the safety and soundness of the\nnational bank, and any effect of the transaction on the national bank\u2019s shareholders, depositors,\nother creditors, and customers.10 The OCC has considered these factors and found them\nconsistent with approval of the Merger. Following the Merger, EGI\u2019s existing subsidiary Atticus\nDigital, Inc. will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. The Bank will not have a\nholding company.\nMerger Consummation Requirements\nThe OCC must be advised in writing in advance of the desired effective date for the Merger, so it\nmay issue the necessary certification letter. The OCC will issue a letter certifying consummation\nof the transaction when it receives:\n1. A Secretary\u2019s Certificate for each institution, certifying that a majority of the board of\ndirectors approved.\n2. An executed merger agreement.\n3. A Secretary\u2019s Certificate from each institution, certifying that the shareholder approvals\nhave been obtained, if required.\n4. Executed amended Articles of Association for the Bank, if applicable.\n5. Documentation that all other required regulatory approvals have been obtained.\nConditions\nThis preliminary conditional approval is subject to the following conditions:\n1. The proposed Bank: (i) shall give the Novel Bank Supervisory Office at least sixty (60)\ndays prior written notice of the proposed Bank\u2019s intent to significantly deviate or change\nfrom its business plan or operations (if such deviation is the subject of an application\nfiled with the OCC, no separate notice to the supervisory office is required); and (ii) shall\nobtain the OCC\u2019s written determination of no objection before the proposed Bank\nengages in any significant deviation or change from its business plan or operations. For\n9 12 USC 371c.\n10 12 CFR 5.33(e)(1)(i).s\n3 the avoidance of doubt, a material deviation includes changes to the proposed Bank\u2019s risk\nand operating limits, as detailed in its business plan, including those established to ensure\nthat the Bank will maintain a highly liquid balance sheet. The OCC may impose\nadditional conditions it deems appropriate in a written determination of no objection to\nthe proposed Bank\u2019s notice. This condition shall remain in effect throughout the Bank\u2019s\nin organization period and during the Bank\u2019s first three years of operation;\n2. Erebor must maintain a minimum 12% Tier 1 Leverage ratio. This condition shall\nremain in effect during the Bank\u2019s first three years of operation; and\n3. Prior to the appointment of any individual to the position of \u201csenior executive officer,\u201d as\ndefined in 12 CFR 5.51(c)(4), which includes the appointment of the Bank Secrecy Act\nOfficer and the Chief Information Security Officer, or the appointment of any individual\nto the board of directors, the proposed Bank shall submit to the OCC the information\ndescribed in the \u201cChanges in Directors and Senior Executive Officers\u201d booklet of the\nComptroller\u2019s Licensing Manual, and receive a letter of no objection from the OCC.\nThis information is required by the authority of 12 USC 1818(b) and 12 CFR 5.20(g) and\ndoes not require the OCC to review or act on any such information within ninety (90)\ndays. This condition shall remain in effect throughout the Bank\u2019s in organization period\nand during the first three years of operations.\nThe conditions of this approval are conditions \u201cimposed in writing by a federal banking agency\nin connection with any action on any application, notice, or other request\u201d within the meaning of\n12 USC 1818. As such, the conditions are enforceable under 12 USC 1818.\nIn addition, the proposed Bank must also meet the following requirements prior to requesting its\npreopening examination and before the OCC will grant final charter approval:\n1. The Bank must engage an independent, external auditor to perform an audit according to\ngenerally accepted auditing standards of sufficient scope to enable the auditor to render\nan opinion on the financial statements of the Bank taken as a whole. The audit period\nshall commence on the date that the organizing group forms a body corporate and may\nend on any calendar quarter-end no later than 12 months after the Bank opens. The OCC\nexpects that such audits will be performed annually for at least three years following\ncommencement of operations. Engagement of an auditor will be verified during the\npreopening examination (see the \u201cCharters\u201d booklet, Internal and External Audits\ndiscussion).\n2. The Bank\u2019s financial statements must be prepared on an accrual basis according to\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\n3. The President must serve as a member of the board of directors.\n4. Each person who, together with his or her related interests, subscribe to 10 percent or\nmore of the initial stock offering must submit a biographical and financial report for\nreview to the Chartering, Organization & Structure staff prior to acquisition of the shares\n4 and staff must have no objection to each person before purchasing the shares. After\nopening the Bank, requirements of the Change in Bank Control Act (12 USC 1817(j))\nwill apply. Changes in the composition of members or trustees of a voting trust or voting\nagreement also may be subject to the requirements of the Change in Bank Control Act.\n5. The Bank must purchase adequate fidelity bond coverage in accordance with 12 CFR\n7.2013, which lists four factors the directors should consider to determine adequacy (see\nthe \u201cCharters\u201d booklet, Fidelity and Other Insurance discussion).\n6. Management and the Board must maintain policies and procedures that address all OCC\nregulations and will guide the Bank\u2019s operations in a safe and sound manner. These\npolicies and procedures must establish and guide the operation of a BSA\/AML\/OFAC\nprogram and a credit risk management program (reflecting appropriate guidance on risk\nrating and accounting for loans accrual status and ensuring a satisfactory allowance for\ncredit losses methodology and balance). Those policies must be completed no later than\nthe date of the applicant\u2019s request for a preopening examination. In addition, the board of\ndirectors must review and adopt the policies and procedures at its first meeting. The\nboard of directors is responsible for regular review and modification of policies and\nprocedures and for assuring continuous compliance with them;\n7. The Bank must have a security program in place that complies with the \u201cInteragency\nGuidelines Establishing Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information\u201d specified at\n12 CFR 30, Appendix B (Appendix B);\n8. The Bank must submit to the Novel Bank Supervision Office for review, and prior\nwritten determination of no supervisory objection, a complete description of the Bank\u2019s\nfinal information systems and operations architecture as well as the information systems\nrisk assessment and management plan, inclusive of the bank\u2019s proprietary core processing\nsystem, which should be fully developed within the stated timelines and in compliance\nwith Appendix B requirements.

A letter must be submitted to the Chartering, Organization and Structure staff at least 60\ndays before the Bank is scheduled to open, notifying the OCC that all conditions and\nrequirements necessary to receive a national bank charter have been met, requesting a\npreopening examination, and providing the anticipated opening date.\nThe Bank\u2019s initial paid-in capital, net of all organizational and preopening expenses, shall be\ncommon equity shares at $100 total, representing non-cash, intangible benefits in the form of\nservices provided to the Bank by the founders.11 The organizers have also issued and will issue\nstock options to Bank employees under the Equity Incentive Plan, in consideration for ongoing\nand future services.12 Additionally, the organizers have represented that no later than 30 days\n11 The Comptroller\u2019s Handbook, \u201cCapital and Dividends\u201d provides that a national bank may issue common stock for\nnoncash consideration, such as services, and that this issuance may qualify as regulatory capital provided it meets\nthe criteria set forth in 12 CFR 3.20(b).\n12 The Comptroller\u2019s Handbook, \u201cCapital and Dividends\u201d states that once earned, employee stock ownership plan\nshares may qualify as common equity tier 1 capital.\n5 following the OCC\u2019s preliminary conditional approval or five days following the closing of\nEGI\u2019s Series A fundraising round, the Bank will enter a binding commitment in substantially the\nsame form as the executed term sheet for a sufficient committed line of equity capital to the\nBank. The Bank will elect to be subject to the CBLR framework and expects to maintain a Tier\n1 Leverage Ratio of no less than 12 percent during the Bank\u2019s first three years of operation.\nUnder the CBLR framework, the Bank must maintain a 9 percent Tier 1 Leverage Ratio to be\n\u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d13\nThe manner in which capital is raised must not deviate from that described in the application\nwithout prior written OCC notification.

Gould issued the following statement today following the Federal Reserve Board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release of guidance to provide clarity on capital instruments for mutual banking organizations: The OCC commends the Federal Reserve Board for its recent action to support mutual banking organizations by providing clarification regarding mutual capital certificates and alternative mutual capital instruments. The OCC fully supports mutual banking organizations, including OCC-supervised federal mutual savings associations. The OCC recently authorized a federal mutual savings association to issue an innovative form of mutual capital certificate that qualifies as regulatory capital. This was the first approval for a mutual capital certificate for a federal mutual savings association in decades. The OCC recognizes the unique role mutual banking organizations serve in their local communities and the challenges of raising capital. Community banks, including mutual banking organizations, play a critical role in lending to local communities and are vital to the strength of the U.S. economy. The OCC will continue to support OCC-supervised mutual savings associations by considering the specific needs of mutual associations through active engagement with the mutual industry.

Background and Policy Objectives\nThe agencies believe that banking regulators\u2019 use of the concept of reputation risk\nas a basis for supervisory criticisms increases subjectivity in banking supervision without\nadding material value from a safety and soundness perspective. Although the agencies\nrecognize the importance of a bank\u2019s reputation, most activities that could negatively\nimpact an institution\u2019s reputation do so through traditional risk channels (e.g., credit risk,\nmarket risk, and operational risk, among others) on which supervisors already focus and\nalready have sufficient authority to address. At the same time, supervising for reputation\nrisk as a standalone risk adds substantial subjectivity to bank supervision and can be\nabused. It also diverts bank and agency resources from more salient risks without adding\nmaterial value from a safety and soundness perspective. To improve the efficiency and\neffectiveness of their supervisory programs, the agencies have removed reputation risk\nfrom their supervisory frameworks and are proposing to codify this change in relevant\nregulations. This change would also respond to concerns expressed in Executive Order\n14331, Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans,1 that the use of reputation risk can\n1 90 FR 38925 (Aug. 7, 2025).\n5 be a pretext for restricting law-abiding individuals\u2019 and businesses\u2019 access to financial\nservices on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.\nThe agencies\u2019 supervisory experience has shown that the use of reputation risk in\nthe supervisory process does not increase the safety and soundness of supervised\ninstitutions because supervisors have little ability to predict ex ante whether or how\ncertain activities or customer relationships present reputation risks that could threaten the\nsafety and soundness of an institution.2 In contrast, risks like credit risk and liquidity risk\nare more concrete and measurable and allow examiners to more objectively assess a\nbanking institution\u2019s financial condition. Assessments of these risks may reflect\nperceptions of a bank\u2019s financial condition consistent with objective principles.\nConversely, an independent consideration of reputation risk by examiners has not\nresulted in consistent or predictable assessments of material financial risk. Instead, by\nfocusing on reputation risk, the agencies have instructed examiners to attempt to map\nevents to public opinion and then public opinion to an institution\u2019s condition in ways that\nhave proven nearly impossible to assess or quantify with accuracy. The agencies\u2019\n2 In carrying out its responsibility, the OCC has refined its examination program based on more than 160\nyears of experience supervising financial institutions and monitoring developments in the financial\nindustry. In the late 1980s and the 1990s, the OCC and other financial regulators shifted toward\nsupervision frameworks that were organized by particular risks. In 1995, the OCC launched an\nexamination program it called \u201csupervision by risk\u201d that led to the current risk-based supervision approach\nto examinations. In the supervision by risk program, the OCC focused on nine categories of risk: credit\nrisk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk, foreign exchange risk, transaction risk, compliance risk,\nstrategic risk, and reputation risk. The program later morphed into the OCC\u2019s current risk-based\nframework, which focuses on eight risk categories, with transaction risk renamed as operational risk and\nforeign exchange risk eliminated as a stand-alone risk. This risk-based supervision program focuses on\nevaluating risk, identifying existing and emerging problems, and ensuring that bank management takes\ncorrective action to address problems before a bank\u2019s safety and soundness is compromised. Similarly, as\nregulators shifted toward risk-based supervision in the 1990s, the FDIC added references to reputation risk\nto manuals and guidance, and supervisors cited reputation risk in formal and informal enforcement actions\nin subsequent years. Generally, the FDIC\u2019s supervision framework has evaluated a variety of risks, such as\nliquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, and reputational risk.\n6 attempts to identify reputation risks and their potential effects on institutions have not\nresulted in increased safety for supervised institutions as supervisors have not been able\nto accurately predict the public\u2019s reaction to business decisions made by institutions.\nIn other words, there is no clear evidence that interference in banks\u2019 activities or\nrelationships in the interest of protecting the banks\u2019 reputations has protected banks from\nlosses or improved banks\u2019 performances.\nIn addition to not enhancing safety and soundness, focusing on reputation risk can\ndistract institutions and the agencies from devoting resources to managing core financial\nrisks\u2014such as credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk\u2014that are quantifiable and\nhave been shown to present significant threats to institutions. Monitoring requires\ndedicated resources. For example, in order to confront such risks, institutions frequently\npurchase expensive risk-monitoring models that must be maintained, implement detailed\nloan review programs, hire expensive outside advisers, and provide time-intensive\ntraining for staff. Parallel to these actions by institutions, the agencies have limited\nresources and a responsibility to use these resources in an efficient and productive\nmanner in furtherance of their statutory responsibilities. In the judgment of the agencies,\nexamining for reputation risk diverts resources that could be better spent on other risks\nthat have been shown to present significant, tangible threats to institutions and that are\nmore easily quantified and addressed through regulatory intervention.\nMoreover, the agencies\u2019 use of reputation risk in reaching supervisory\nconclusions introduces subjectivity and unpredictability into the agencies\u2019 judgments.\nRegardless of how much the agencies refine their supervisory approaches to reflect\ndifferences among institutions, agency supervision more effectively fosters safe and\n7 sound banking when supervised institutions have a reasonable expectation of how the\nagencies would evaluate an activity. The agencies have not clearly explained how banks\nshould measure the reputation risk from different activities, business partners, or clients,\nnor have the agencies clearly articulated the criteria for which activities, business\npartners, or clients are deemed to present reputation risk. Without clear standards, the\nagencies\u2019 supervision for reputation risk has been inconsistent and has at times reflected\nindividual perspectives rather than data-driven conclusions. Different stakeholders may\nhave different perspectives on how such activities or relationships impact an institution\u2019s\nreputation, if at all, which creates unpredictability and inconsistency for regulated\nentities. Additionally, the subjective nature of supervisory decisions about reputation risk\nintroduces the potential for political or other biases into the supervisory process. Thus,\nsupervisory judgments about reputation risk can create subjective regulatory interference\nin day-to-day business decisions that are better left to the judgment of the regulated\ninstitutions. Given the difficulty of measuring reputation risk in an accurate and precise\nway, it is inappropriate for the agencies\u2019 supervisors to examine supervised institutions\nagainst this risk.\nMore importantly, when a supervised institution alters its behavior to comply with\nsupervisory expectations relating to reputation risk management, such as by closing an\naccount or choosing not to enter into or continue a business relationship with a customer\nthat it would otherwise maintain, it is forgoing an opportunity to maintain or build a\nprofitable business relationship that may otherwise be consistent with sound risk\nmanagement practice. Accordingly, the agencies\u2019 past practice of encouraging\nsupervised institutions to alter their behavior due to reputation risk may have adversely\n8 impacted institutions\u2019 earnings, capital positions, and safety and soundness. In this way,\nthe agencies\u2019 prior focus on reputation risk may have caused supervised institutions to be\nless safe and sound than had they been permitted to engage in lawful business activities\nwithout these limitations resulting from supervisory expectations surrounding reputation\nrisk.\nIn addition, examining for reputation risk can result in agency examiners\nimplicitly or explicitly encouraging institutions to restrict access to banking services on\nthe basis of examiners\u2019 personal views of a group\u2019s or individual\u2019s political, social,\ncultural, or religious views or beliefs, constitutionally protected speech, or politically\ndisfavored but lawful business activities. This can result in unfair treatment of different\ngroups and impermissible restrictions on a group\u2019s or individual\u2019s ability to access\nfinancial services. This practice can also result in distortions to industries and the U.S.\neconomy, as the agencies\u2019 examiners use reputation risk to choose winners and losers\namong market participants and industries.\nMoreover, even if reputation risk could be quantified, the agencies lack evidence\nthat reputation risk, in the absence of identified financial or operational risks, is a factor\nthat can hurt an institution\u2019s safety and soundness. While there are examples of risks like\ncredit risk and liquidity risk being the primary driver of an institution\u2019s unsafe or unsound\ncondition, the agencies have not seen evidence that reputation risk can be the primary\ndriver of an institution being in unsafe or unsound condition. When reputational issues\nare identified as a root cause of harm that has impacted a supervised institution\u2019s\nfinancial condition, there are typically other more significant factors, such as those\nrelating to the institution\u2019s capital, asset quality, liquidity, earnings, or interest rate\n9 sensitivity, that are the primary drivers of the institution\u2019s weakened financial condition.\nThe OCC\u2019s supervision is required by law to focus on the safety and soundness of its\ninstitutions and compliance with laws and regulations as well as, as applicable, fair\naccess to financial services and fair treatment of customers.3 The FDIC is responsible for\nthe supervision and examination of state nonmember banks, including for safety and\nsoundness principles.4 In furtherance of these objectives, the agencies\u2019 supervision\nshould focus on concrete risks and objective criteria directly related to applicable\nstatutory requirements. In the agencies\u2019 experience, using reputation risk in its\nsupervisory process does not further this mission.\nII. Description of the Proposed Rule and Changes\nBased on the above-described supervisory experience and the ineffectiveness of\nusing reputation risk to improve the safety and soundness of supervised institutions, the\nagencies have removed reputation risk from their supervisory frameworks and are\nproposing to codify this change in relevant regulations. This proposed rule would be a\nregulation as defined in section 5 of Executive Order 14192. The proposed rule would be\na significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. The proposed\nelimination of reputation risk supervision is deregulatory.\nUnder 12 U.S.C. 1(a), the OCC is charged with assuring the safety and soundness\nof, and compliance with laws and regulations, fair access to financial services, and fair\ntreatment of customers by, the institutions and other persons subject to its jurisdiction.\nSimilarly, the FDIC has statutory authority to administer the affairs of the Corporation,\n3 12 U.S.C. 1.\n4 See 12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq. The FDIC also insures the deposits of insured depository institutions and\nmanages receiverships of failed depository institutions.\n10 which includes a framework for banking supervision.5 Further, the FDIC\u2019s Board of\nDirectors has the authority to prescribe rules and regulations as it may deem necessary to\ncarry out the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,6 and the OCC is authorized\nto prescribe rules and regulations to carry out the responsibilities of the office.7\nBased on these authorities, the subjectivity of reputation risk, the inefficacy of\nreputational risk at identifying risks to safety and soundness or other statutory mandates,\nand the potential for regulatory overreach and abuse, the agencies have removed\nreputation risk from their supervisory frameworks and are proposing regulations to codify\nthis change in relevant regulations. The proposed rule would not alter or affect the ability\nof an institution to make business decisions regarding its customers or third-party\narrangements and to manage them effectively, consistent with safety and soundness and\ncompliance with applicable laws.\nThe proposed rule would prohibit the agencies from criticizing, formally or\ninformally, or taking adverse action against an institution on the basis of reputation risk.\nIn addition, under the proposal, the agencies would be prohibited from requiring,\ninstructing, or encouraging an institution or its employees to refrain from contracting\nwith or to terminate or modify a contract with a third party, including an institution-\naffiliated party, on the basis of reputation risk. The agencies also could not require,\ninstruct, or encourage an institution or its employees to refrain from doing business with\nor to terminate or modify a business relationship with a third party, including an\ninstitution-affiliated party, on the basis of reputation risk. The proposed rule would also\n5 See 12 U.S.C. 1819(a), 1820(a).\n6 12 U.S.C. 1819(a)(Tenth), 1820(g).\n7 12 U.S.C. 93a.\n11 prevent the agencies from requiring, instructing, or encouraging an institution to enter\ninto a contract or business relationship with a third party on the basis of reputation risk.\nThe proposed rule would further prohibit the agencies from requiring, instructing, or\nencouraging an institution or an employee of an institution to terminate a contract with,\ndiscontinue doing business with, or modify the terms under which it will do business with\na person or entity on the basis of the person\u2019s or entity\u2019s political, social, cultural, or\nreligious views or beliefs, constitutionally protected speech, or solely on the basis of the\nthird party\u2019s involvement in politically disfavored but lawful business activities perceived\nto present reputation risk.\nThis prohibition would not affect requirements intended to prohibit or reject\ntransactions or accounts associated with Office of Foreign Assets Control-sanctioned\npersons, entities, or jurisdictions. Such prohibitions and rejections would not be based\nspecifically on \u201cthe person\u2019s or entity\u2019s political, social, cultural, or religious views or\nbeliefs, constitutionally protected speech, or politically disfavored but lawful business\nactivities perceived to present reputation risk.\u201d The prohibition also does not affect the\nagencies\u2019 authority to enforce the requirements of the provisions of United States Code\ntitle 31, chapter 53, subchapter II regarding reporting on monetary transactions.8\nHowever, due to the broad nature of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)9 and anti-money\nlaundering (AML) supervision, there is a risk that BSA\/AML focused supervisory actions\ncould indirectly address reputation risk. The proposal would prohibit supervisors from\nusing BSA and anti-money laundering concerns as a pretext for reputation risk. In\n8 15 U.S.C. 5311 et seq.\n9 Id.\n12 addition, although the agencies would continue to consider the statutory factors required\nwith respect to certain applications,10 the proposal would prohibit supervisors from using\nthese provisions as a pretext for reputation risk, as described in this proposal, in making\ndeterminations regarding such applications.\n\u201cAdverse action,\u201d as defined by the proposed rule, would include the provision of\nnegative feedback, including feedback in a report of examination, a memorandum of\nunderstanding, verbal feedback, or an enforcement action. Furthermore, \u201caction\u201d\nencompasses any action of any agency employee, including any communication\ncharacterized as informal, preliminary, or not approved by agency officials or senior\nstaff. A downgrade (or contribution to a downgrade) of any supervisory rating, including\na rating assigned under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System or comparable\nrating system, also would constitute an \u201cadverse action\u201d under the proposed rule. In\naddition, a downgrade (or contribution to a downgrade) of a rating under the Uniform\nInteragency Consumer Compliance Rating System or the Uniform Rating System for\nInformation Technology, or any other rating system, would also constitute an \u201cadverse\naction\u201d under the proposed rule. Further, a denial of a filing or licensing application or\nan imposition of a capital requirement above the minimum ratios would constitute an\n\u201cadverse action\u201d under the proposed rule, as would any burdensome requirements placed\non an approval, the introduction of additional approval requirements, or any other\nheightened requirements on an activity or change.\n10 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 1816 (requiring the FDIC to consider, among other things, the \u201cgeneral character and\nfitness of the management of the depository institution\u201d in an application for deposit insurance); 12 U.S.C.\n1817(j)(2)(B) (requiring the agencies to \u201cconduct an investigation of the competence, experience, integrity,\nand financial ability of each person named\u201d as a proposed acquirer of an institution following a notice of a\nproposed change in control of a depository institution).\n13 The agencies are also including a general \u201ccatch-all\u201d for any other actions that\ncould negatively impact the institution outside of traditional supervisory channels. This\ncatch-all is meant to include actions such as supervisory decisions on applications for\nwaivers outside of the normal licensing or filing channels, applications to engage in\ncertain business activities for which supervisory permission is required, or other\nregulatory decisions affecting institutions. Intent is the defining characteristic for\nwhether an agency-action would fall into this catch-all provision. As an illustration of\nagency actions that would be subject to this prohibition, the prohibition would prevent the\nagencies from, for example: disapproving a proposed member of a board of directors on\nthe basis of an unsubstantiated pretense where the true reason is reputation risk, denying\na waiver of bank director citizenship and residency requirements for the purpose of\ninducing a bank to address perceived reputation risk somewhere in the bank\u2019s operations,\nor disapproving a change of control notice because a bank lacks internal reputation risk\ncontrols. Agency actions subject to this prohibition would also include negative feedback\nthat is verbal, a condition attached to an approval, the introduction of new approval\nrequirements, and any other heightened requirements that are intended to force the bank\nto address perceived reputation risk.\nThe term \u201cdoing business with\u201d in the proposed rule is intended to be construed\nbroadly and to include business relationships both with bank clients and with third-party\nservice providers. It is also intended to include the relationship of a bank with\norganizations or individuals that the bank is providing with charitable services, including\nas part of a community benefits agreement or as part of a Community Reinvestment Act\nplan. This term is intended to include both existing business relationships and\n14 prospective business relations.\nThe term \u201cinstitution-affiliated party\u201d has the same meaning as in section 3 of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act.11\nThe proposed rule would define \u201creputation risk\u201d as the risk, regardless of how\nthe risk is labeled by the institution or by the agencies, that an action or activity, or\ncombination of actions or activities, or lack of actions or activities, of an institution could\nnegatively impact public perception of the institution for reasons unrelated to the current\nor future financial condition of the institution. This definition is intended to include not\njust risks that the agencies or the institution identify as \u201creputation risks,\u201d but any similar\nrisk based around concerns regarding the public\u2019s perception of the institution beyond the\nscope of other risks in the agencies\u2019 supervisory frameworks. This definition is not\nintended to capture risks posed by public perceptions of the institution\u2019s current or future\nfinancial condition because such perceptions relate to risks other than reputation risk. For\nexample, public perceptions that a bank has insufficient liquidity and therefore is\nsusceptible to a bank run would not be considered reputation risk.\nThe prohibitions of the proposed rule would apply to actions taken on the basis of\nreputation risk; political, social, cultural, or religious views and beliefs; constitutionally\nprotected speech; or solely based on bias against politically disfavored but lawful\nbusiness activities perceived to present reputation risk. The proposed rule would not\nprohibit criticism, supervisory feedback, or other actions to address traditional risk\nchannels related to safety and soundness and compliance with applicable laws, including\n11 Pub. L. 81-797, 64 Stat. 873 (codified at 12 U.S.C. 1813(u)).\n15 credit risk, market risk, and operational risk (including cybersecurity, information\nsecurity, and illicit finance), provided that such criticism, supervisory feedback or other\nactions addressing these other risks is not a pretext by examiners aimed at reputation risk.\nUnder the proposed rule, the OCC would make seven conforming amendments to\nthe OCC\u2019s regulations to eliminate references to reputation risk. These conforming\namendments would be made in (1) the list of risks a national bank shall consider, as\nappropriate, as set out in 12 CFR part 1 of the OCC regulations;12 and (2) the safety and\nsoundness standards set forth in 12 CFR part 30 of the OCC regulations, including the\nOCC guidelines.13 The OCC regulations at 12 CFR part 30 would include six\nconforming amendments.14\nRegulations codified in 12 CFR part 41 of the OCC regulations and 12 CFR part\n334 of the FDIC\u2019s regulations refer to reputation risk concerning certain identity theft\nprevention programs required by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of\n2003.15 However, by statute, guidelines and regulations for these programs must occur\njointly across certain federal agencies,16 so no conforming amendment is suggested for\n12 12 CFR 1.5(a). The OCC added reputation risk between the proposal and finalization of the regulation.\nSee 60 FR 66157, 66161 (Dec. 21, 1995); 61 FR 63980, 63985 (Dec. 2, 1996).\n13 12 CFR part 30, appendices B, C, D, and E. The OCC and other agencies jointly issued supplement A to\nappendix B pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 6801 and then-existing guidance. 70 FR 15737 (Mar. 29, 2005). Fifteen\nU.S.C. 6801(b) requires each relevant agency to establish appropriate standards, but it does not require joint\nissuances or references to reputation risk. The OCC issued appendix C pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1,\nwhich allows the prescription of several types of standards but does not refer to reputation risk. See 70 FR\n6329 (Feb. 7, 2005); 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1. Appendix C includes three references to reputation risk. The\nOCC issued appendices D and E pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1 in furtherance of the goals of the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376. 79 FR\n54518 (Sept. 11, 2014); 81 FR 66792 (Sept. 29, 2016).\n14 The proposal would not change 12 CFR 3.101(b) where a definition excludes reputation risk.\n15 Pub. L. 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952 (codified at 15 U.S.C. 1681\u20131681x); see 12 CFR 41.90(b)(3)(ii); see\nalso 12 CFR 334.90(b)(3)(ii).\n16 See 15 U.S.C. 1681m(e); 72 FR 63720 (Nov. 9, 2007) (discussing the definition that refers to reputation\nrisk and linking it to 15 U.S.C. 1681m(e)).\n16 12 CFR part 41 or 12 CFR part 334. The OCC and FDIC are considering making\nchanges to 12 CFR parts 41 and 334, respectively, in a separate, joint rulemaking in the\nfuture. Until that separate, joint rulemaking occurs, the agencies expect to exercise their\ndiscretion in enforcing 12 CFR parts 41 and 334 by using agency resources to assess\ncompliance without regard to reputation risk.\nUnder the proposed rule, the FDIC would make one conforming amendment to\nthe FDIC\u2019s regulations relating to reputation risk. This amendment would be made in the\nsafety and soundness standards set forth in 12 CFR part 364 of the FDIC\u2019s regulations.17\nThe proposed rule would eliminate the reference to reputation risk in the regulation.\nIII. Request for Comments and Use of Plain Language\nThe agencies seek comment on all aspects of the proposed rule, including the\nfollowing:\n1. Do commenters believe the enumerated prohibitions capture the types of actions that\nadd undue subjectivity to bank supervision? If there are other prohibitions that would be\nwarranted, please identify such prohibitions and explain.\n2. Is the definition of \u201cadverse action\u201d in the proposed rule sufficiently clear? Should the\ndefinition be broader or narrower? Are there other types of agency actions that should be\nincluded in the list of \u201cadverse actions?\u201d Does the catch-all provision at the end of the\ndefinition of \u201cadverse action\u201d appropriately capture any agency action that is intended to\npunish or discourage banks on the basis of perceived reputation risk? Is such catch-all\nprovision sufficiently clear?\n17 12 CFR part 364.\n17 3. Are commenters aware of any other uses of reputation risk in supervision or in the\nagencies\u2019 regulations that should be addressed in this rule? If so, please describe such\nuses and their effects on institutions.\n4. Do commenters believe the definition of \u201creputation risk\u201d should be broadened or\nnarrowed? If so, how should the definition be broadened or narrowed? Please provide\nthe reasoning to support any suggested changes.\n5. Do commenters understand what is meant by the phrase \u201csolely on the basis of the\nthird party\u2019s involvement in lawful business activities that are perceived to present\nreputation risk?\u201d Could the agencies word this prohibition more clearly? Should the\nword \u201csolely\u201d be included? Would it be better to say \u201csolely or partially?\u201d\n6. Are there alternatives to the proposed rule that would better achieve the agencies\u2019\nobjective? If so, please describe any such alternatives.\n7. Are there changes to the proposed rule that would help restrict the agencies\u2019 ability to\nevade the rule\u2019s requirements, including evasion through mislabeling a risk or through\nusing alternative adverse actions? Is there other anti-evasion language that should be\nincluded?\n8. The proposed definition of \u201creputation risk\u201d includes risks that could negatively impact\npublic perception of an institution for reasons unrelated to the financial condition of the\ninstitution. Should this be broadened to include reasons unrelated to the financial or\noperational condition of the institution?\n9. Should the list of relationships that would constitute \u201cdoing business with\u201d include\nadditional types of relationships?\n18 10. Does the removal of reputation risk create any other unintended consequences for the\nagencies or their supervised institutions?\n11. Would the proposed rule have any costs, benefits, or other effects that the agencies\nhave not identified? If so, please describe any such costs, benefits, or other effects.\nAdditionally, section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act18 requires the federal\nbanking agencies to use plain language in all proposed and final rules published after\nJanuary 1, 2000. The agencies have sought to present the proposed rule in a simple and\nstraightforward manner, and invite comment on the use of plain language. For example:\n12. Have the agencies organized the material to suit your needs? If not, how could the\nagencies present the proposed rule more clearly?\n13. Are the requirements in the proposed rule clearly stated? If not, how could the\nproposed rule be more clearly stated?\n14. Do the regulations contain technical language or jargon that is not clear? If so, which\nlanguage requires clarification?\n15. Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, use of headings,\nparagraphing) make the regulation easier to understand? If so, what changes would\nachieve that?\n16. Would more, but shorter, sections be better? If so, which sections should be changed?\nWhat other changes can the agencies incorporate to make the regulation easier to\nunderstand?\nIV. Expected Effects\n18 Public Law 106-102, sec. 722, 113 Stat. 1338, 1471 (1999); 12 U.S.C. 4809.\n19 OCC:\nA. Background\nAs previously discussed, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their\nsupervisory programs, the agencies are proposing revising their supervisory frameworks\nto remove reputation risk. The proposed rule would prohibit the OCC from criticizing or\ntaking adverse actions (broadly defined) against an institution on the basis of reputation\nrisk. The proposed rule would define \u201creputation risk\u201d as the risk, regardless of how the\nrisk is labeled by the institution or by the agencies, that an action or activity, or\ncombination of actions or activities, or lack of actions or activities, of an institution could\nnegatively impact public perception of the institution for reasons unrelated to the\nfinancial condition of the institution. The proposed rule would also prohibit the agencies\nfrom requiring, instructing, or encouraging an institution or any employee of an\ninstitution to terminate a contract with, discontinue doing business with, sign a contract\nwith, initiate doing business with, modify the terms under which it will do business with\na person or entity, or take any action or refrain from taking any action on the basis of the\nperson\u2019s or entity\u2019s political, social, cultural, or religious views or beliefs or solely on the\nbasis of the person\u2019s or entity\u2019s involvement in lawful business activities perceived to\npresent reputational risk. The proposed rule would not prohibit criticism, supervisory\nfeedback, or other actions to address traditional risk channels related to safety and\nsoundness and compliance with applicable laws, including credit risk, market risk, and\noperational risk (including cybersecurity, information security, and illicit finance),\nprovided that such criticism, supervisory feedback or other actions addressing these other\nrisks is not a pretext by examiners aimed at reputational risk.\n20 Under the proposed rule, the OCC would make seven conforming amendments to\nthe OCC\u2019s regulations relating to reputation risk. These conforming amendments would\nbe made in (1) the list of risks a national bank shall consider, as appropriate, as set out in\n12 CFR part 1 of the OCC regulations; and (2) the safety and soundness standards set\nforth in 12 CFR part 30 of the OCC regulations.\nB. Current legal and regulatory baselines\nThere are two regulatory baselines that may be assessed. Under the first baseline,\non March 20, 2025, the OCC issued OCC Bulletin 2025-4 wherein the OCC issued\nguidance that removed references to banks\u2019 reputation risk from its \u201cComptroller\u2019s\nHandbook\u201d booklets and guidance issuances. In addition, the OCC instructed its\nexaminers that they should no longer examine for reputation risk.\nTherefore, under this first legal and regulatory baseline, the OCC already\ndiscontinued reputation risk-based supervision since March 2025, and the proposed rule\nwould create a formal legal mandate to remove reputation risk from OCC supervision.\nEffectively, there would be no additional burden, and therefore no compliance costs since\nreputation risk would not be examined effective with OCC Bulletin 2025-4. Any cost\nsavings would be de minimis since references to bank\u2019s reputation risk were already\nremoved, per OCC Bulletin 2025-4.\nUnder the second baseline, which considers the scenario absent OCC Bulletin\n2025-4, however, the OCC would have continued to supervise institutions for reputation\nrisk.\n21 C. Parties affected by the proposal\n1. OCC-regulated entities affected by the rule\nThe OCC currently supervises 1,017 national banks, Federal savings associations,\ntrust companies and Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks (collectively,\nbanks).19 Because all OCC-regulated banks and institutions were subject to reputation\nrisk assessments, the proposed rule would affect all 1,017 institutions supervised.\n2. Other parties\nBecause the proposed rule aims to remove the influence of the agencies\u2019\nreputation risk assessments on institutions\u2019 customer relationships, we conclude that the\nproposed rule could potentially affect all OCC-regulated institutions\u2019 current and future\ncustomers.\nD. Costs and benefits\n1. Cost savings from decreased regulatory compliance burden\nWhile the proposed rule does not address regulated institutions\u2019 internal practices\nof how to address reputation risk, the OCC expects that the proposed rule would,\nnonetheless, result in a decrease in regulated institutions\u2019 costs primarily through reduced\nregulatory compliance burden, relative to the second baseline. The OCC would no longer\nexamine for reputation risk nor issue any related adverse supervisory actions. In turn,\ninstitutions would no longer have to engage in reputation risk examinations and respond\nto any related adverse supervisory actions. The OCC estimates that the cost savings could\nbe significant depending on the level of effort an institution put forth to prepare for\n19 Based on OCC internal Financial Institution Data Retrieval System (FINDRS) with data as of August 1,\n2025.\n22 reputation risk examinations. Although the OCC is unable to thoroughly quantify cost\nsavings due to decreased regulatory compliance burden, the OCC notes that there is a\nnon-trivial percentage of Matters Requiring Attention (MRAs) that mentioned\n\u201creputation risk.\u201d The table below calculates the percentage of MRA-related text\nsummaries that mentioned the word \u201creputation\u201d from all available summaries. The\ntable20 shows that 12.42 percent of MRAs mentioned \u201creputation risk\u201d in 2024. While\nmany of these MRAs were not solely due to reputation risk, given the persistence and\nincreased occurrence of reputation risk in MRAs, one could expect that removing\nreputation risk would result in significant cost savings for institutions that had to respond\nto reputation risk-related MRAs.\n2. Benefits from increased business opportunities\nThe impact of the proposed rule on OCC-regulated institutions depends\nsignificantly on the extent to which the OCC may have changed regulated institutions\u2019\nbehavior in response to the OCC\u2019s expectation in managing reputation risk, relative to the\n20 We measure the compliance burden by calculating the percentage of recent MRAs that mentioned\nreputation risk prior to the release of OCC Bulletin 2025-4.\n23 second baseline. On the one hand, the OCC\u2019s expectations in managing reputation risk\nmay not have been binding; regulated institutions may internally perceive reputation risk\nas an important aspect in maintaining or growing their customer base.\nOn the other hand, the OCC\u2019s expectations in managing reputation risk may have\ncaused changes in institutions\u2019 behavior in response to reputation risk concerns by\nencouraging institutions to refrain from and\/or terminate existing customer relationships.\nA consequence of the OCC\u2019s actions could have been preventing banks from entering\ninto or continuing profitable business relationships with law-abiding customers that banks\nwould have maintained in the absence of OCC expectations. Indeed, in 2016 the House\npassed the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act,21 which was meant to address\nalleged abuses by Federal banking regulators that pressured financial institutions to\nterminate services for legal businesses based solely on \"reputational risk.\u201d\nWhile Sachdeva et al.22 show that targeted banks decreased lending to and\nterminated relationships with affected firms that were deemed controversial, results\nsuggest that the firms substituted credit through nontargeted banks under similar terms.\nAs such, targeted credit rationing did not substantially change the performance of the\naffected firms. However, even though it did not substantially affect the performance of\nthe affected firms, the affected firms nonetheless had to incur search costs and burden in\nfinding alternatives.\n21 The bill never became law because it was not passed in the Senate.\n22 See Kunal Sachdeva et al., Defunding Controversial Industries: Can Targeted Credit Rationing Choke\nFirms?, 172 J. Fin. Econ. 104133 (2025).\n24 We conclude that the proposed rule should benefit customers by formally\neliminating reputation risk related regulatory restrictions and constraints on their business\nrelationships because the proposed rule would decrease the search costs and burden\nassociated with finding alternatives. Additionally, we conclude that the proposed rule\nshould benefit regulated institutions by eliminating constraints on relationships related to\nreputation risk that would otherwise be profitable.\n3. Benefits from less subjective supervision\nOne additional benefit from the removal of reputation risk is greater consistency\nand objectivity of supervisory decisions, relative to the second baseline. This in turn,\nwould increase the predictability for regulated institutions to understand and manage\nregulators\u2019 supervisory expectations.\nIn our analysis, we attempted to quantitatively compare the subjectivity of OCC\nsupervisory text that mentions or does not mention the word \u201creputation.\u201d In our analysis,\nwe use standard natural language processing algorithms23 to calculate a subjectivity score\nfor individual OCC supervisory texts. The supervisory text includes descriptions of\nsignificant supervisory events and MRA text descriptions that we also utilized in section\nD.1 of this document. We calculate the subjectivity score for each individual text\ndocument, and the scores range from 0 to 1 and scores closer to 1 are indicative of more\nsubjective text.\nFor the significant supervisory event text data, we calculated an average\nsubjectivity score of 0.41 for text that mentions reputation and an average score of 0.28\n23 Specifically, we used the Python TextBlob package, which calculates a subjectivity score based on the\ntext provided.\n25 for supervisory event text that does not mention reputation. For the MRA text data, we\ncalculated average subjectivity scores of 0.43 and 0.33 from text that mentions and does\nnot mention reputation, respectively.\nFDIC:\nThis analysis utilizes all regulations and guidance applicable to FDIC-supervised\ninsured depository institutions (IDIs), as well as information on the financial condition of\nIDIs as of the quarter ending March 31, 2025, as the baseline to which the effects of the\nproposed rule are estimated.\nIf adopted, the proposed regulations would indirectly benefit FDIC-supervised\nIDIs or associated persons to the extent they would have been the subject of an adverse\naction or prohibition against certain business relationships by the agencies on the basis of\nreputation risk; political, social, cultural, or religious views and beliefs; constitutionally\nprotected speech; or politically disfavored but lawful business activities perceived to\npresent reputation risk. This benefit would occur as the IDI or associated person would\navoid any costs associated with such adverse actions or prohibitions. Additionally, the\nimproved efficiency and effectiveness of the FDIC\u2019s supervisory programs may also\nindirectly benefit covered IDIs. Further, IDIs may incur some voluntary costs associated\nwith making changes to their compliance policies and procedures. As of the quarter\nending March 31, 2025, the FDIC supervised 2,835 IDIs.24 The FDIC does not have the\ninformation necessary to quantify number of instances, or the associated costs, where an\nIDI or person was subject to a covered adverse action or prohibition against certain\n24 Call Report data, March 31, 2025.\n26 business relationships. Nor does the FDIC have the information necessary to quantify the\nnumber of IDIs that might make changes to their compliance policies and procedures.\nHowever, the FDIC believes that such instances are very infrequent, based on their\nsupervisory experience. The FDIC believes that the aggregate economic effect of any\nsuch indirect benefits or costs is unlikely to be substantive.\nThe FDIC invites comments on all aspects of this analysis. In particular, would\nthe proposed rule have any costs or benefits that the agencies have not identified?\nV. Regulatory Analysis\nPaperwork Reduction Act\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 199525 (PRA) states that no agency may\nconduct or sponsor, nor is the respondent required to respond to, an information\ncollection unless it displays\na currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The\nagencies have reviewed this proposed rule and determined that it does not create any\ninformation collection or revise any existing collection of information. Accordingly, no\nPRA submissions to OMB will be made with respect to this proposed rule.\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\nOCC:\nIn general, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)26 requires an agency, in\nconnection with a proposed rule, to prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis\ndescribing the impact of the rule on small entities (defined by the U.S. Small Business\n25 44 U.S.C. 3501\u20133521.\n26 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.\n27 Administration (SBA) for purposes of the RFA to include commercial banks and savings\ninstitutions with total assets of $850 million or less and trust companies with total assets\nof $47 million or less). However, under section 605(b) of the RFA, this analysis is not\nrequired if an agency certifies that the proposed rule would not have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities and publishes its certification\nand a short explanatory statement in the Federal Register along with its proposed rule.\nThe OCC currently supervises approximately 609 small entities, all of which may\nbe impacted by the proposed rule.27 In general, the OCC classifies the economic impact\non an individual small entity as significant if the total estimated impact in one year is\ngreater than 5 percent of the small entity\u2019s total annual salaries and benefits or greater\nthan 2.5 percent of the small entity\u2019s total non-interest expense. Furthermore, the OCC\nconsiders 5 percent or more of OCC-supervised small entities to be a substantial number.\nThus, at present, 30 OCC-supervised small entities would constitute a substantial number.\nUnder the baseline with OCC Bulletin 2025-4, the proposed rule would have a de\nminimis effect on small entities. Under the baseline absent OCC Bulletin 2025-4, the\nproposed rule would affect all small OCC-regulated entities and would therefore affect a\nsignificant number of small entities. However, because the proposed rule would result in\nsignificant cost savings for all OCC-regulated institutions, the OCC expects the proposed\nrule would not have a significant adverse impact on small entities. Thus, the OCC finds\n27 We base our estimate of the number of small entities on the SBA\u2019s size thresholds for commercial banks\nand savings institutions, and trust companies, which are $850 million and $47 million, respectively.\nConsistent with the General Principles of Affiliation, 13 CFR 121.103(a), we count the assets of affiliated\nfinancial institutions when determining if we should classify an OCC-supervised institution as a small\nentity. We use December 31, 2024, to determine size because a \u201cfinancial institution's assets are determined\nby averaging the assets reported on its four quarterly financial statements for the preceding year.\u201d See\nfootnote 8 of the SBA\u2019s Table of Size Standards.\n28 that the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial\nnumber of OCC-supervised small entities under either baseline.\nFDIC:\nThe RFA generally requires an agency, in connection with a proposed rule, to\nprepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis\nthat describes the impact of the proposed rule on small entities.28 However, an initial\nregulatory flexibility analysis is not required if the agency certifies that the proposed rule\nwill not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of\nsmall entities. The SBA has defined \u201csmall entities\u201d to include banking organizations\nwith total assets of less than or equal to $850 million.29 Generally, the FDIC considers a\nsignificant economic impact to be a quantified effect in excess of 5 percent of total\nannual salaries and benefits or 2.5 percent of total noninterest expenses. The FDIC\nbelieves that effects in excess of one or more of these thresholds typically represent\nsignificant economic impacts for FDIC-supervised institutions. As discussed further\nbelow, the FDIC certifies that the proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial number of FDIC-supervised small entities.\nThe proposed rule would, if adopted, apply only to the activities of the FDIC.\nAs such, this rule would not impose any obligations on FDIC-supervised entities, and\n28 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.\n29 The SBA defines a small banking organization as having $850 million or less in assets, where an\norganization's \u201cassets are determined by averaging the assets reported on its four quarterly financial\nstatements for the preceding year.\u201d See 13 CFR 121.201 (as amended by 87 FR 69118, effective December\n19, 2022). In its determination, the \u201cSBA counts the receipts, employees, or other measure of size of the\nconcern whose size is at issue and all of its domestic and foreign affiliates.\u201d See 13 CFR 121.103.\nFollowing these regulations, the FDIC uses an IDI's affiliated and acquired assets, averaged over the\npreceding four quarters, to determine whether the insured depository institution is \u201csmall\u201d for the purposes\nof the RFA.\n29 FDIC-supervised entities would not need to take any action in response to this rule.\nTherefore, the FDIC certifies that the proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of FDIC-supervised small entities\nbecause proposed rule would not have any direct effect on the public or FDIC-supervised\ninstitutions.\nThe FDIC invites comments on all aspects of the supporting information provided\nin this RFA section. The FDIC is particularly interested in comments on any significant\neffects on small entities that the agency has not identified.\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act\nThe OCC has analyzed the proposed rule under the factors in the Unfunded\nMandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA).30 Under this analysis, the OCC considered\nwhether the proposed rule includes a Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure\nby State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100\nmillion or more in any one year ($187 million as adjusted annually for inflation).\nPursuant to section 202 of the UMRA,31 if a proposed rule meets this UMRA threshold,\nthe OCC would need to prepare a written statement that includes, among other things, a\ncost-benefit analysis of the proposal.\nThe OCC estimates that the proposal would not require additional expenditure\nfrom OCC-regulated entities. As noted earlier, there would likely be a decrease in\nexpenditures due to the removal of compliance mandates, resulting in cost savings. The\nOCC\u2019s estimated UMRA cost is $0. Therefore, the OCC finds that the proposed rule\n30 2 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.\n31 2 U.S.C. 1532.\n30 does not trigger the UMRA cost threshold. Accordingly, the OCC has not prepared the\nwritten statement described in section 202 of the UMRA.\nRiegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994\nPursuant to section 302(a) of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory\nImprovement Act (RCDRIA) of 1994,32 in determining the effective date and\nadministrative compliance requirements for new regulations that impose additional\nreporting, disclosure, or other requirements on insured depository institutions, the OCC\nand FDIC must consider, consistent with principles of safety and soundness and the\npublic interest (1) any administrative burdens that the final rule would place on\ndepository institutions, including small depository institutions and customers of\ndepository institutions and (2) the benefits of the final rule. This rulemaking would not\nimpose any reporting, disclosure, or other requirements on insured depository\ninstitutions. Therefore, section 302(a) does not apply to this final rule.\nProviding Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023\nThe Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act of 202333 requires that a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking include the internet address of a summary of not more\nthan 100 words in length of a proposed rule, in plain language, that shall be posted on the\ninternet website www.regulations.gov.\nThe OCC and FDIC propose codifying the elimination of the use of reputation\nrisk from their risk-based supervisory frameworks. The proposal would prohibit the\nagencies from forcing an institution to refrain from contracting or doing business with an\n32 12 U.S.C. 4802(a).\n33 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(4).\n31 individual or entity or to terminate, modify, or initiate a contract or business relationship\non the basis of reputation risk. The agencies also could not force an institution to\nterminate a contract or discontinue or modify a business relationship on the basis of an\nindividual\u2019s or entity\u2019s political, social, cultural, or religious views or beliefs,\nconstitutionally protected speech, or lawful business activities.\nThe proposal and required summary can be found for the OCC at\nhttps:\/\/www.regulations.gov by searching for Docket ID OCC-2025-0142 and\nhttps:\/\/occ.gov\/topics\/laws-and-regulations\/occ-regulations\/proposed-issuances\/index-\nproposed-issuances.html, and for the FDIC at\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/resources\/regulations\/federal-register-publications\/index.html#.\nExecutive Order 12866 (as amended)\nExecutive Order 12866, titled \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review,\u201d as amended,\nrequires the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), OMB, to determine\nwhether a proposed rule is a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d prior to the disclosure of the\nproposed rule to the public. If OIRA finds the proposed rule to be a \u201csignificant\nregulatory action,\u201d Executive Order 12866 requires the OCC to conduct a cost-benefit\nanalysis of the proposed rule and for OIRA to conduct a review of the proposed rule prior\nto publication in the Federal Register. Executive Order 12866 defines a \u201csignificant\nregulatory action\u201d to mean a regulatory action that is likely to (1) have an annual effect\non the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the\neconomy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,\npublic health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a\nserious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another\n32 agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or\nloan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal\nor policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President\u2019s priorities, or the principles\nset forth in Executive Order 12866.\nOIRA has determined that this proposed rule is a significant regulatory action\nunder section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, is subject to review under\nExecutive Order 12866. The OCC\u2019s analysis conducted in connection with Executive\nOrder 12866 is included above under the \u201cExpected Impacts\u201d section of this document.\nThe FDIC\u2019s analysis conducted in connection with Executive Order 12866 is also\nincluded above under the \u201cExpected Effects\u201d section of this document.\nExecutive Order 14192\nExecutive Order 14192, titled \u201cUnleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,\u201d\nrequires that an agency, unless prohibited by law, identify at least 10 existing regulations\nto be repealed when the agency publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise\npromulgates a new regulation with total costs greater than zero. Executive Order 14192\nfurther requires that new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the\nextent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at\nleast 10 prior regulations. Under either baselines with OCC Bulletin 2025-4 or absent the\nOCC Bulletin 2025-4, this proposed rule is a deregulatory action under Executive Order\n14192 because it results in potential cost savings for OCC-supervised institutions.\nList of Subjects\n12 CFR Part 1\nBanks, banking, National banks, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,\n33 Securities.\n12 CFR Part 4\nAdministrative practice and procedure, Freedom of information, Individuals with\ndisabilities, Minority businesses, Organization and functions (Government agencies),\nReporting and recordkeeping requirements, Women.\n12 CFR Part 30\nAdministrative practice and procedure, National banks, Reporting and\nrecordkeeping requirements.\n12 CFR Part 302\nAdministrative practice and procedure, Banks, banking.\n12 CFR Part 364\nBanks, banking, Information.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\n12 CFR Chapter I\nAuthority and Issuance\nFor the reasons set forth in the preamble, the OCC proposes to amend parts 1, 4,\nand 30 of chapter I of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:\nPART 1\u2014INVESTMENT SECURITIES\n1.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-97 | October 7, 2025 Agencies Issue Proposal to Focus Supervision on Material Financial Risks Share This Page: Joint Release Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the agencies) today issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would continue their effort to focus supervision on material financial risks. Among other things, the proposal would define the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cunsafe or unsound practice\u00e2\u0080\u009d for purposes of section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and revise the supervisory framework for the issuance of matters requiring attention (MRAs) and other supervisory communications.

Introduction\nThe OCC and the FDIC (collectively, the agencies) exercise their enforcement\nand supervision authority to ensure that supervised institutions1 refrain from engaging in\nunsafe or unsound practices. To that effect, the agencies believe it is important to\npromote greater clarity and certainty regarding certain enforcement and supervision\nstandards by defining them by regulation. Moreover, the agencies believe it is critical that\nexaminers and institutions prioritize material financial risks over concerns related to\npolicies, process, documentation, and other nonfinancial risks and that their enforcement\nand supervision standards further that prioritization.\nSpecifically, pursuant to the provisions of section 8 of the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1818), the agencies are authorized to take\nenforcement actions against depository institutions2 and institution-affiliated parties3 that\nhave engaged in an \u201cunsafe or unsound practice.\u201d As described in section II.A of this\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the agencies are proposing to define by\nregulation the term \u201cunsafe or unsound practice\u201d for purposes of section 8 of the FDI Act.\n1 For purposes of this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the term \u201cinstitution\u201d refers to insured\ndepository institutions and any other institutions subject to supervision or enforcement by the agencies. The\nscope of the proposed rule is discussed below.\n2 A depository institution generally refers to an insured depository institution as defined in 12 U.S.C.\n1813(c)(2); any national banking association chartered by the OCC, including an uninsured association; or\na branch or agency of a foreign bank. Refer to specific provisions of 12 U.S.C. 1818 regarding their\napplicability to a specific institution. See 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(4)\u2013(5).\n3 See id. 1813(u).\n5 The proposed implementation of the definition of \u201cunsafe or unsound practice\u201d would\napply to the agencies\u2019 supervisory and enforcement activities prospectively only.\nMoreover, it would not apply to the agencies\u2019 rulemaking activities or authority.\nIn addition, the agencies are proposing to establish uniform standards for purposes\nof their communication of certain supervisory concerns. The agencies each communicate\ndeficiencies that rise to the level of a matter that requires attention from an institution\u2019s\nboard of directors and management, but the agencies have different standards for when\nthe agency may communicate these deficiencies.4 As described in section II.B of this\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the agencies are proposing to establish uniform\nstandards for when and how the agencies may communicate matters requiring attention\n(MRAs) as part of the supervision and examination process, consistent with their\nunderlying statutory authorities. The proposal also clarifies that the agencies may\ncommunicate other nonbinding suggestions to institutions orally or in writing to enhance\nan institution\u2019s policies, practices, condition, or operations as long as the communication\nis not, and is not treated by the agency in a manner similar to, an MRA.\nII. Description of the Proposed Rule\nA. Unsafe or Unsound Practices\nBased on the agencies\u2019 supervisory experience and as a matter of policy, the\nagencies propose implementing a definition of \u201cunsafe or unsound practice\u201d for purposes\nof section 8 of the FDI Act that would focus on material risks to the financial condition of\nan institution and would generally require that an imprudent practice, act, or failure to\nact, if continued, would be likely to materially harm the institution\u2019s financial condition.\n4 Specifically, as discussed in more detail below, the OCC has procedures for the communication of matters\nrequiring attention (MRAs). The FDIC communicates matters requiring board attention (MRBAs).\n6 Taking into account statutory text, legislative history, and case law, the agencies believe\nthat the proposed regulatory definition fits within the authority Congress granted to the\nagencies to take enforcement actions based on unsafe or unsound practices under section\n8 of the FDI Act.5 The agencies believe this change will provide greater consistency for\ninstitutions and institution-affiliated parties and appropriately focus supervisory and\ninstitution resources on the most critical financial risks to institutions and the financial\nsystem.\nThe term \u201cunsafe or unsound practice\u201d appears in section 8 of the FDI Act for\npurposes of the agencies\u2019 enforcement authority. The statute does not define the term\nunsafe or unsound practice. An unsafe or unsound practice may serve as a ground for\nseveral types of enforcement actions under provisions of section 8 of the FDI Act. These\ninclude involuntary termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC,6 a cease-and-desist\norder,7 a temporary cease-and-desist order,8 the removal and prohibition of an institution-\n5 See Groos Nat\u2019l Bank v. OCC, 573 F.2d 889, 897 (5th Cir. 1978) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018unsafe or unsound\nbanking practice\u2019 is widely used in the regulatory statutes and in case law, and one of the purposes of the\nbanking acts is clearly to commit the progressive definition and eradication of such practices to the\nexpertise of the appropriate regulatory agencies.\u201d).\n6 12 U.S.C. 1818(a)(2)\u2013(3) (\u201cIf the [FDIC] Board of Directors determines that an insured depository\ninstitution or the directors or trustees of an insured depository institution have engaged or are engaging in\nunsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of the depository institution . . . the [FDIC] Board\nof Directors may issue an order terminating the insured status of such depository institution effective as of a\ndate subsequent to such finding.\u201d).\n7 Id. 1818(b)(1) (\u201cIf, in the opinion of the appropriate Federal banking agency, any insured depository\ninstitution, depository institution which has insured deposits, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging\nor has engaged, or the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the depository institution or any\ninstitution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of\nsuch depository institution . . . the agency may issue and serve upon the depository institution or the\ninstitution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such . . . practice.\u201d).\n8 Id. 1818(c)(1) (\u201cWhenever the appropriate Federal banking agency shall determine that . . . the unsafe or\nunsound practice or practices . . . or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant\ndissipation of assets or earnings of the depository institution, or is likely to weaken the condition of the\ndepository institution or otherwise prejudice the interests of its depositors prior to the completion of the\nproceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, the agency may issue a\ntemporary order requiring the depository institution or such party to cease and desist from any such . . .\npractice and to take affirmative action to prevent or remedy such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or\nprejudice pending completion of such proceedings.\u201d).\n7 affiliated party,9 or a Tier 2 or Tier 3 civil money penalty.10 Most enforcement provisions\nin section 8 of the FDI Act also include other potential grounds, such as a violation of law\nor a breach of fiduciary duty, which are not affected by the proposed regulatory\ndefinition.\nThe ordinary meaning of the term \u201cunsafe,\u201d as defined by the dictionaries most\ncommonly used at the time section 8 of the FDI Act was enacted, is a sufficient degree of\nrisk of sufficient harm, injury, or damage to make a situation not safe.11 They defined the\nterm \u201cunsound\u201d as a sufficient degree of actual harm, injury, or damage to make a thing\nnot sound.12\nIn determining what may be considered an unsafe or unsound practice under\nsection 8 of the FDI Act, some courts have looked to a standard articulated by John\nHorne, then Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) (Horne\nStandard), during congressional hearings related to the Financial Institutions Supervisory\n9 Id. 1818(e) (Subject to additional requirements, \u201c[w]henever the appropriate Federal banking agency\ndetermines that any institution-affiliated party has, directly or indirectly . . . engaged or participated in any\nunsafe or unsound practice in connection with any insured depository institution or business institution . . .\nthe appropriate Federal banking agency may suspend such party from office or prohibit such party from\nfurther participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the depository institution . . . .\u201d).\n10 Id. 1818(i) (\u201c[A]ny insured depository institution which, and any institution-affiliated party who . . .\nrecklessly engages in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the affairs of such insured depository\ninstitution . . . which practice is part of a pattern of misconduct; causes or is likely to cause more than a\nminimal loss to such depository institution; or results in pecuniary gain or other benefit to such party, shall\nforfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each day during which such . . . practice . . .\ncontinues . . . .

Simpson & E.S.C. Weiner, Oxford English Dictionary 355\u201366 (2d ed. 1989) (safe); 19\nid. at 180 (unsafe).\n12 See, e.g., 16 id. at 50\u201352 (sound); 19 id. at 206 (unsound).\n8 Act of 1966 (Act of 1966), which is the source of the agencies cease-and-desist authority\nin section 8(b) of the FDI Act.13 Specifically, Chairman Horne stated:\nGenerally speaking, an \u201cunsafe or unsound practice\u201d embraces any action,\nor lack of action, which is contrary to generally accepted standards of\nprudent operation, the possible consequences of which, if continued,\nwould be abnormal risk or loss or damage to an institution, its\nshareholders, or the agencies administering the insurance funds.14\nRepresentative Patman further described the authority added in the Act of 1966 as \u201caimed\nspecifically at actions impairing the safety or soundness of. . . insured financial\ninstitutions\u201d and providing the agencies with \u201cflexible tools [that] relate strictly to the\ninsurance risk and to assure the public. . . sound banking facilities.\u201d15\nCourts reviewing cases brought by the agencies have grappled with the meaning\nof \u201cunsafe or unsound practice\u201d in section 8 of the FDI Act and have reached different\nconclusions as to how to apply it. For example, some courts have applied the Horne\nStandard without further elaboration on what the standard entails.16 Other courts have\nexplained that section 8 of the FDI Act applies to practices that have a \u201creasonably direct\neffect on an [institution]\u2019s financial soundness\u201d17 or \u201cthreaten the financial integrity\u201d of\nthe institution.18 Other courts have required that unsafe or unsound practices cause\n13 See, e.g., Gulf Fed. Sav. & Loan Assoc. of Jefferson Parish v. Fed. Home Loan Bank Bd., 651 F.2d 259,\n264 (5th Cir. 1981) (\u201cThe authoritative definition of an unsafe or unsound practice, adopted in both Houses,\nwas a memorandum submitted by John Horne\u201d). Chairman Horne\u2019s articulation of what constitutes an\nunsafe or unsound practice was read into the record in both chambers of Congress. See 112 Cong. Rec.\n25008, 26474 (1966) (remarks of Rep. Thomas W.L. Ashley and Sen. Absalom W. Robertson).\n14 112 Cong. Rec. 26474.\n15 Id. at 24984 (remarks of Rep. Wright Patman).\n16 See, e.g., Greene Cnty. Bank v.

The agencies believe that the proposed regulatory\ndefinition faithfully reflects the intent of the standard as enacted by Congress and aligns\nwith the interpretations of the term unsafe or unsound practice within section 8 of the FDI\nAct by most Federal courts. The proposed regulatory definition would also provide a\nconsistent nationwide standard to provide greater clarity for institutions and institution-\naffiliated parties.\nThe agencies believe that the proposed definition of the term unsafe or unsound\npractice is also important to appropriately focus institution and examiner attention on\npractices that are likely to materially harm an institution\u2019s financial condition, providing\nthe institution\u2019s board of directors and management additional flexibility to enact day-to-\nday decisions based on their business judgment and risk tolerance. The proposed\ndefinition reflects the agencies\u2019 judgment and experience that their supervisory resources\nare best focused on practices that are likely to materially harm an institution\u2019s financial\ncondition, such as risks that are more likely than other risks to lead to material financial\nlosses, bank failures, and instability in the banking system.22 For the same reasons, the\n19 In re Seidman, 37 F.3d 911, 928 (3d Cir. 1994); see also id. at 932 (stating that \u201c[a]n unsafe or unsound\npractice has two components: (1) an imprudent act (2) that places an abnormal risk of financial loss or\ndamage on a banking institution\u201d).\n20 Michael v. FDIC, 687 F.3d 337, 352 (7th Cir. 2012) (citing In re Seidman, 37 F.3d at 932).\n21 Blanton v. OCC, 909 F.3d 1162, 1172 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting Landry v. FDIC, 204 F.3d 1125, 1138\n(D.C. Cir. 2000)).\n22 In March 2023, several insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or\nmore, including Silicon Valley Bank, experienced significant withdrawals of uninsured deposits in\n10 agencies believe that practices that are likely to materially harm the financial condition of\nan institution are critical for an institution\u2019s board of directors and management to\naddress.\nIn addition, lack of clarity regarding the scope of the term unsafe or unsound\npractice among examiners could lead to inconsistent application of the terms in\ncommunicating supervisory findings.23 The proposed definition of an unsafe or unsound\npractice should ensure consistency in identifying practices as unsafe or unsound only\nwhere they are likely to materially harm the financial condition of an institution, are\nlikely to present a material risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), or have\nmaterially harmed the financial condition of the institution. This definition should focus\ninstitution and examiner attention on core financial risks facing an institution and\notherwise provide the institution\u2019s board of directors and management the flexibility to\nenact decisions based on their business judgment and risk tolerance.\nTherefore, as explained further below, in the proposed rule, the agencies would\ndefine the term unsafe or unsound practice to mean a practice, act, or failure to act, alone\nor together with one or more other practices, acts, or failures to act, that (1) is contrary to\ngenerally accepted standards of prudent operation; and (2)(i) if continued, is likely to (A)\nmaterially harm the financial condition of the institution; or (B) present a material risk of\nloss to the DIF; or (ii) materially harmed the financial condition of the institution.\nresponse to underlying material weaknesses in their financial position and failed. The agencies believe\nthese failures highlight the need for the agencies to allocate supervisory resources with a focus on material\nfinancial risks.\n23 In addition to enforcement actions under section 8 of the FDI Act, the agencies identify unsafe or\nunsound practices as supervisory findings in other communications, including reports of examination,\nsupervisory letters, MRAs, and informal enforcement actions. These identified unsafe or unsound practices\nsometimes establish a record for a later enforcement action under section 8 of the FDI Act. The agencies\u2019\nidentification of an unsafe or unsound practice is distinct from standards for safety and soundness that the\nagencies are required to issue pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1. See 12 CFR parts 30, 364.\n11 Imprudent act. Consistent with the Horne Standard, a practice, act, or failure to\nact under the proposed definition would have to be contrary to generally accepted\nstandards of prudent operation to be considered an unsafe or unsound practice.24 The\nagencies acknowledge that an essential role of institutions is to identify, measure, incur,\nand manage risk. The agencies do not intend to take enforcement actions under section 8\nof the FDI Act for prudent operations that result in risk-taking. A practice, act, or failure\nto act could only be considered an unsafe or unsound practice if it deviates from\ngenerally accepted standards of prudent operation (and otherwise meets the proposed\ndefinition).\nLikely. To qualify as an unsafe or unsound practice under the proposed definition,\nit also would have to be likely\u2014as opposed to, for example, merely possible\u2014that the\npractice, act, or failure to act, if continued, would materially harm the financial condition\nof the institution or present a material risk of loss to the DIF. The agencies believe that\nincluding the term \u201cif continued\u201d is important to allow for identification of an unsafe or\nunsound act or failure to act before it impacts an institution\u2019s financial condition.\nHowever, the conduct must be sufficiently proximate to a material harm to an\ninstitution\u2019s financial condition to meet the proposed definition.25 The agencies do not\nintend to identify unsafe or unsound acts or failures to act by extrapolating from deficient\nconduct that could potentially result in, alone or in combination with other factors or\nevents, material harm to the financial condition of an institution but is not likely to do so.\n24 See, e.g., Michael, 687 F.3d at 352 (citing Van Dyke v. FRB, 876 F.2d 1377, 1380 (8th Cir. 1989));\nFrontier State Bank Okla. City, Okla. v. FDIC, 702 F.3d 588, 604 (10th Cir. 2012) (citing Simpson v. OTS,\n29 F.3d 1418, 1425 (9th Cir. 1994)); De la Fuente v. FDIC, 332 F.3d 1208, 12222 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing\nSimpson, 29 F.3d at 1425).\n25 Additionally, under the proposal, practices, acts, or failures to act that have already caused material harm\nto the financial condition of the institution would not have to meet the \u201clikely\u201d standard, as there would be\ncertainty with respect to the harm.\n12 Moreover, the agencies considered, but did not propose, more precisely defining the\nrequisite likelihood under the proposed definition, such as through a minimum percentage\n(e.g., 10%, 51%). Instead, the agencies invite comment on whether a minimum\npercentage likelihood or more precise definition of \u201clikely\u201d is appropriate.\nFinancial condition. An unsafe or unsound practice would include a practice, act,\nor failure to act that, if continued, is likely to materially harm the financial condition of\nan institution. The agencies believe that harm to financial condition includes practices,\nacts, or failures to act that are likely to directly, clearly and predictably impact an\ninstitution\u2019s capital, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, or sensitivity to market risk.\nRisk of Loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund. An unsafe or unsound practice would\nalso include a practice, act, or failure to act that, if continued, is likely to negatively affect\nan institution\u2019s ability to avoid FDIC receivership and present a material risk of loss to\nthe DIF as a result of the failure. For example, the failure of an institution to implement\nappropriate contingency funding arrangements might not pose a risk of material harm to\nthe financial condition of the institution, but could impair the institution\u2019s liquidity under\nstress and thus present an increased risk to the DIF. In other words, the proposed\ndefinition would capture a practice, act, or failure to act that materially increases the\nprobability that an institution would fail and impose a material risk of loss to the DIF.\nHarm. The proposed standard focuses on material harm to financial condition,\nand the agencies generally interpret harm to refer to financial losses. Therefore, to be an\nunsafe or unsound practice, a practice, act, or failure to act generally must have either\ncaused actual material losses to the institution or must be likely to cause material loss or\n13 other negative financial impacts to the institution.26 Conversely, that a practice, act, or\nfailure to act caused actual but non-material financial losses to the institution is\ninsufficient to meet the proposed standard.27\nNonfinancial risks impacting financial condition. The agencies also acknowledge\nthat, in limited circumstances, other practices, acts, or failures to act may be captured\nbecause, if continued, they are likely to cause material harm to an institution\u2019s financial\ncondition. For example, the term unsafe or unsound practice could include critical\ninfrastructure or cybersecurity deficiencies that are so severe as to, if continued, be likely\nto result in a material disruption to the institution\u2019s core operations that prevent the\ninstitution, its counterparties, and its customers from conducting business operations and,\nin turn, be likely to cause material harm to the financial condition of the institution. The\nstandard would not include risks to the institution\u2019s reputation unrelated to financial\ncondition.28\nMaterial harm. Under the proposed definition, to be considered an unsafe or\nunsound practice, the likely harm to an institution\u2019s financial condition or risk of loss to\nthe DIF must also be material. Risks of minor harm to an institution\u2019s financial condition,\neven if imminent, would not rise to the level of an unsafe or unsound practice.29 Instead,\nthe agencies will consider the likely harm to an institution\u2019s financial condition to be\n26 See Landry, 204 F.3d at 1138.\n27 See Johnson v. OTS, 81 F.3d at 204.\n28 See Gulf Fed. Sav. & Loan Assoc. of Jefferson Parish, 651 F.2d at 264\u201365 (\u201cApproving intervention\nunder the [FHLBB]\u2019s \u201closs of public confidence\u201d rationale would result in open-ended supervision. . . . The\nBoard\u2019s rationale would permit it to decide, not that the public has lost confidence in Gulf Federal\u2019s\nfinancial soundness, but that the public may lose confidence in the fairness of the association\u2019s contracts\nwith its customers.\u201d).\n29 See, e.g., id. at 259 (an institution with $75 million in assets did not engage in an unsafe or unsound\npractice when it misrepresented the calculation of interest rates on loans, which could have resulted in an\n$80,000 loss to the institution\u2014a loss of far less than 1% of the institution\u2019s total assets).\n14 material if it would materially impact the institution\u2019s capital, asset quality, liquidity,\nearnings, or sensitivity to market risk,30 or would materially impact the risk that an\ninstitution fails and causes a loss to the DIF. Going forward, the agencies expect that it\nwould be rare for an institution to exhibit unsafe or unsound practices, as defined in the\nproposed rule, based solely on the institution\u2019s policies, procedures, documentation or\ninternal controls, without significant weaknesses in the institution\u2019s financial condition\n(i.e., weaknesses that caused material harm to the financial condition of the institution, or\nwere likely to materially harm the financial condition of the institution or likely to present\nmaterial risk of loss to the DIF). The agencies considered but did not propose to more\nprecisely define the materiality of harm required under the proposed definition, such as\nthrough measures of capital or liquidity outflows. Instead, the agencies invite comment\non what, if any, more precise measures of material harm are appropriate.\nTailoring required. The proposal also explains that the agencies will tailor their\nsupervisory and enforcement actions under 12 U.S.C. 1818 (as well as their issuance of\nMRAs, as discussed further below) based on the capital structure, riskiness, complexity,\nactivities, asset size, and any financial risk-related factor that the agencies deem\nappropriate. This includes tailoring with respect to the requirements or expectations set\nforth in such actions as well as whether, and the extent to which, such actions are taken.\nAs such, the agencies expect that finding an unsafe or unsound practice would be a much\nhigher bar for a community bank than for a larger institution when considered against the\noverall operations of the institution. For example, as applied to the threshold for material\n30 See, e.g., Blanton, 909 F.3d at 1172\u201373 (an institution-affiliated party engaged in an unsafe or unsound\npractice by permitting a customer to overdraft more than $2 million over two months, with outstanding\noverdrafts at one point totaling nearly 65% of the institution\u2019s Tier 1 capital, even though the institution\u2019s\ncapital levels were critically deficient).\n15 harm, the agencies would not expect that a particular projected percentage decrease in\ncapital or liquidity that rises to the level of materiality for the largest institutions would\nnecessarily also be material for community banks. The agencies invite comment on\nwhether the agencies should provide additional specificity. Generally, because unsafe or\nunsound practices by institution-affiliated parties must, if continued, be likely to\nmaterially harm the financial condition of an institution, the same tailored standard\nwould, going forward, apply to practices, acts, or failures to act by institution-affiliated\nparties of the institution.\nFor these reasons, the agencies propose to define the term unsafe or unsound\npractice to mean a practice, act, or failure to act, alone or together with other practices,\nacts, or failures to act, that (1) is contrary to generally accepted standards of prudent\noperation; and (2)(i) if continued, is likely to (A) materially harm the financial condition\nof an institution; or (B) present a material risk of loss to the DIF; or (ii) materially\nharmed the financial condition of the institution.\nB. Matters Requiring Attention\nThe agencies are proposing to establish uniform standards for examiners\u2019\ncommunication of MRAs. Under the proposed rule, an examiner would be permitted to\nissue an MRA to address certain risks to the financial condition of an institution and\nviolations of banking or banking-related laws or regulations.\nThrough various statutory examination and reporting authorities, Congress has\nconferred upon the agencies the authority to exercise visitorial powers and examination\nauthorities with respect to supervised institutions.31 The Supreme Court has indicated\n31 12 U.S.C. 481, 1463, 1464, 1820, 1867, 3105(c), 5412(b).\n16 support for a broad reading of certain visitorial powers.32 Examination and visitorial\npowers of the agencies facilitate early identification of supervisory concerns that may not\nrise to a violation of law, unsafe or unsound practice, or breach of fiduciary duty under\nsection 8 of the FDI Act. These powers provide the agencies with authority to issue\nMRAs and supervisory ratings.33\nThe OCC\u2019s current practice is to use MRAs to communicate concerns about an\ninstitution\u2019s \u201cdeficient practices.\u201d34 A deficient practice is a practice, or lack of practice,\nthat (1) \u201cdeviates from sound governance, internal control, or risk management principles\nand has the potential to adversely affect the bank\u2019s condition, including financial\nperformance or risk profile, if not addressed,\u201d or (2) \u201cresults in substantive\nnoncompliance with laws or regulations, enforcement actions, or conditions imposed in\nwriting in connection with the approval of any applications or other requests by the\n[institution].\u201d35 The purpose of an MRA, unlike other forms of supervisory\ncommunications, is to bring a deficient practice to the attention of the institution\u2019s board\nof directors and management to ensure they address the deficiency. An MRA is not\nintended to serve as a vehicle for examiners to recommend best practices or\nenhancements to already acceptable standards. When the OCC communicates an MRA to\nan institution, it includes a corrective action stating what management or the board of\ndirectors must do to address the concern and eliminate the cause.36 An institution is\nexpected to develop an action plan to detail how it intends to correct the root causes of\n32 See, e.g., Cuomo v. Clearing House Ass\u2019n, 557 U.S. 519 (2009); United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315\n(1991); United States v. Phila. Nat\u2019l Bank, 374 U.S. 321 (1963).\n33 See 12 U.S.C. 481, 1463, 1820(b), 1867, 3105(c), 5412(b).\n34 OCC, Comptroller\u2019s Handbook, \u201cBank Supervision Process\u201d at 46 (March 2025).\n35 Id. at 134.\n36 Id. at 46.\n17 deficiencies rather than symptoms.37 Although an institution has discretion to develop an\nadequate action plan as it deems appropriate, the OCC retains the ultimate authority to\ndetermine the method and timeframe for corrective action. The actions that an\ninstitution\u2019s board of directors and management take or agree to take in response to\nconcerns in MRAs are factors in the OCC\u2019s decision to pursue an enforcement action and\nthe severity of that action.38\nThe OCC tracks an institution\u2019s MRAs, including whether they are open, closed,\npast due, or pending validation. Current OCC policies require that MRAs must remain\nopen until an institution has implemented, and examiners have verified and validated that\nthe institution has consistently adhered to, an effective corrective action.39 Validation\nrequires the institution to demonstrate the corrective action is effective over a reasonable\nperiod, which may vary and is based on the sustainability of the corrected practice, not\nthe institution\u2019s condition.40\nFor matters that do not warrant an MRA, examiners may offer informal\nrecommendations to the board of directors and management related to potential policy\nenhancements or best practices.41 Recommendations do not require specific corrective\naction or follow-up by examiners, and the OCC does not include recommendations in\nformal written communications to institutions, such as a report of examination.\n37 Id. at 38.\n38 OCC, Policies and Procedures Manual: PPM 5310-3, \u201cBank Enforcement Actions and Related Matters\u201d\nat 3 (May 25, 2022), available at https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/news-issuances\/bulletins\/2023\/bulletin-2023-16.html.\n39 \u201cVerification\u201d is the process by which the OCC confirms that an institution has implemented the agreed\nupon corrective actions to address a deficient practice described in an MRA. \u201cValidation\u201d is the process by\nwhich the OCC confirms the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective actions that an institution has\nimplemented.\n40 The OCC must determine through examination or review of audit reports and work papers that the\ninstitution's corrective actions are sustainable.\n41 OCC, Comptroller\u2019s Handbook, \u201cBank Supervision Process\u201d at 46.\n18 The FDIC\u2019s current practice is to issue Supervisory Recommendations, including\nMatters Requiring Board Attention (MRBAs), as part of its supervisory process to\ncommunicate weaknesses in a bank\u2019s operations, governance, or risk management\npractices.42 These supervisory tools are designed to promote timely corrective action and\nto strengthen institutions\u2019 overall safety and soundness.\nMRBAs are used to inform an institution of the FDIC\u2019s views about changes\nneeded in its practices, operations, or financial condition to help institutions prioritize\ntheir efforts to address examiner concerns, identify emerging problems, and correct\ndeficiencies before the institution\u2019s condition deteriorates.43 Boards of directors are\nexpected to oversee management\u2019s development and implementation of corrective\nmeasures and to ensure timely resolution of the matters. The FDIC reviews the status of\nMRBAs in subsequent examinations or through offsite monitoring to ensure progress and\nremediation. The FDIC tracks and categorizes MRBAs to enable the agency to analyze\nand identify trends related to risk supervision findings.\nOther Supervisory Recommendations are issued to highlight deficiencies or\nweaknesses that warrant management\u2019s attention but do not rise to the level of MRBAs.\nThese recommendations are intended to promote sound governance, risk management,\nand operational practices and, if left unaddressed, may escalate into more significant\nsupervisory concerns. Although these Supervisory Recommendations do not carry the\nsame weight as MRBAs, management is expected to consider and respond to them and to\nimplement corrective action as appropriate.\n42 See Statement of the FDIC Board of Directors on the Development and Communication of Supervisory\nRecommendations, available at https:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/about\/governance\/ recommendations.html.\n43 See FDIC, Risk Management Manual of Examination Policies, Report of Examination Instructions (last\nupdated April 2024), at 16.1-8.\n19 The agencies each apply their different standards for MRAs and MRBAs\n(collectively, matters requiring correction) to require institutions to align their conduct\nwith supervisory expectations. But a common denominator of the agencies\u2019 current\npractices for supervisory criticisms is that examiners frequently issue matters requiring\ncorrection to communicate deficiencies beyond those that are central to, or in many cases\nthat are directly relevant to, an institution\u2019s financial condition. The agencies do not\ncurrently require examiners to find that a practice is likely, or reasonably can be\nexpected, to materially harm the financial condition of the institution. In practice, an\ninstitution must address the practices described in a matter requiring correction,\nregardless of whether the institution\u2019s board of directors and management consider the\nexaminer\u2019s concerns to be accurate or important enough to prioritize. The agencies\u2019\nexpansive definition and application of matters requiring correction has resulted in a\nproliferation of supervisory criticisms for immaterial procedural, documentation, or other\ndeficiencies that distract management from conducting business and that do not clearly\nimprove the financial condition of institutions. In addition, in the agencies\u2019 supervisory\nexperience, failure to correct a deficient practice communicated in a matter requiring\ncorrection often eventually results in an enforcement action.\nTo ensure supervision efforts are appropriately focused on material financial risks\nand increase consistency in supervisory criticisms, the agencies are issuing this joint\nproposal regarding their standard for issuing matters requiring correction, which would\nbe in the form of MRAs.44\n44 For the FDIC, MRAs would replace MRBAs.\n20 The proposed rule would provide that the agencies may only issue an MRA for a\npractice, act, or failure to act, alone or together with one or more other practices, acts, or\nfailures to act, that (1)(i) is contrary to generally accepted standards of prudent operation;\nand (ii)(A) if continued, could reasonably be expected to, under current or reasonably\nforeseeable conditions, (1) materially harm the financial condition of the institution; or\n(2) present a material risk of loss to the DIF; or (B) has already caused material harm to\nthe financial condition of the institution; or (2) is an actual violation of a banking or\nbanking-related law or regulation.\nUnder the proposed rule, the phrases \u201cmaterially harm the financial condition of\nan institution,\u201d \u201cmaterially harmed the financial condition of an institution,\u201d and\n\u201cmaterial risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund\u201d would have the same meaning for\nMRAs as they would have for the proposed definition of unsafe or unsound practice. The\nproposed MRA standard would accordingly focus supervisory and institution resources\non material financial risks. Similar to the proposed definition of an unsafe or unsound\npractice, practices, acts, or failures to act that are captured by the proposed MRA\nstandard would, in the vast majority of cases, relate directly to risks of material harm to\nthe financial condition of an institution or violations of certain laws and regulations.\nMaterial financial risks will, in the vast majority of cases, relate directly, clearly and\npredictably to an institution\u2019s capital, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, or sensitivity to\nmarket risk. Additionally, the proposed standard for an MRA, like the proposed\ndefinition of an unsafe or unsound practice, would cover a practice, act, or failure to act\nthat, \u201cif continued,\u201d has the potential to materially harm the financial condition of an\ninstitution.\n21 As proposed, examiners could communicate an MRA for a practice, act, or failure\nto act that, if continued, could reasonably be expected to, under current or reasonably\nforeseeable conditions, (A) materially harm the financial condition of an institution or (B)\npresent a material risk of loss to the DIF. The agencies intend for the \u201ccould reasonably\nbe expected to, under current or reasonably foreseeable conditions\u201d element in the\nproposed MRA standard to present a lower bar than does the \u201clikely\u201d element in the\nproposed unsafe or unsound practice standard.\nTo determine whether a practice, act, or failure to act, if continued, could\nreasonably be expected to, under current or reasonably foreseeable conditions, materially\nharm the financial condition of an institution, the proposed rule relies on examiners\u2019\njudgments, based on objective facts and sound reasoning. The proposal would not permit\nexaminers to issue MRAs based on potential future conditions that are possible but not\nreasonably foreseeable. Nonetheless, \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d does not necessarily mean\nthe most likely future outcome and could include a range of possible outcomes. For\nexample, in late 2022, the agencies could have considered it \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d\nthat the federal funds rate and other market interest rates would rise considerably, and an\ninstitution\u2019s vulnerability to a significant rise in interest rates could have been grounds\nfor an MRA. However, the proposal would not permit examiners to issue MRAs that\npurport to meet the proposed MRA standard as a pretext to force an institution to comply\nwith an examiner\u2019s managerial judgment instead of the judgment of the institution\u2019s own\nmanagement, in the absence of a reasonable expectation of material harm to the financial\ncondition of the institution.\n22 Under the proposed MRA standard, violations of banking or banking-related laws\nand regulations must be actual violations of a discrete set of federal and state law or\nregulation\u2014those related to banking. This would generally include banking and\nconsumer financial protection laws, but would not include laws and regulations outside of\nthe banking and consumer finance context, such as tax laws.45 Moreover, the agencies\nwould not issue an MRA solely to address an institution\u2019s policies, procedures, or\ninternal controls, unless those policies, procedures, or internal controls otherwise satisfied\nthe regulatory standard for an MRA, even if those policies, procedures, or internal\ncontrols could lead to a violation of law or regulation. Accordingly, under the proposed\nrule, examiners could issue an MRA for a practice, act, or failure to act related to a\nviolation of law or regulation only if (1) the examiner identified actual violations of a\nbanking or banking-related law or regulation (as opposed to, for example, bank policies,\nprocedures, or programs that could lead to violations of such laws or regulations) or (2)\nthe practice, act, or failure to act meets the MRA standard in the proposed rule relating to\nmaterial financial harm.\nAs discussed above, the agencies will tailor their issuance of MRAs based on the\ncapital structure, riskiness, complexity, activities, asset size, and any financial risk-related\nfactor that the agencies deem appropriate. This includes tailoring with respect to the\nrequirements or expectations set forth in such actions as well as whether, and the extent\nto which, such actions are taken.\n45 Banking and consumer financial protection laws include the enumerated consumer laws under the\nConsumer Financial Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. 5481(12), only with respect to institutions for which the\nagencies have supervisory or enforcement authority under such laws under 12 U.S.C. 5515\u20135516.\n23 The agencies also recognize that a more targeted use of MRAs, as proposed in\nthis rule, may benefit from complementary changes to the agencies\u2019 MRA verification\nand validation procedures to ensure MRAs are lifted as soon as practicable after the\ninstitution completes corrective actions. The agencies note that, under current practices,\nMRAs are often kept outstanding for a prolonged period of time after an institution has\nfully completed its remediation of the underlying practice, act, or failure to act because\nexaminers seek to see demonstrated sustainability of the remediation before an MRA is\nclosed. This practice has the potential to distract an institution\u2019s board of directors and\nmanagement, as well as examiners, by inflating the number of MRAs based on practices,\nacts, or failures to act that have already been remediated. The agencies invite comment on\nways in which the agencies can improve their respective MRA verification and validation\npolicies and procedures.\nInformal Supervisory Communications\nFor concerns that do not rise to the level of an MRA, agency examiners may\ninformally provide non-binding suggestions to enhance an institution\u2019s policies,\npractices, condition, or operations.46 The OCC refers to these communications as\n\u201csupervisory observations.\u201d For example, examiners could offer suggestions on ways to\nenhance an institution\u2019s external audit practices, succession planning, or risk management\nprocesses. Given that these supervisory communications are not binding, the agencies\nwould not be permitted to require an institution to submit an action plan to incorporate\nexaminers\u2019 supervisory observations. Examiners would not be permitted, and the\n46 Supervisory observations are separate and distinct from requirements that the agencies impose in\nconnection with an application, notice, or other request, including through a condition imposed in writing\nunder 12 U.S.C. 1818.\n24 institution would not be required, to track the institution\u2019s adoption or implementation of\nexaminer suggestions. Although examiners would be permitted to informally make such\nsupervisory communications to the institution\u2019s board of directors, the institution\u2019s\nmanagement would not be required to present the supervisory communications to the\ninstitution\u2019s board of directors. In addition, the agencies would not be permitted to\ncriticize an institution for declining to remediate a concern or weakness identified by\nsuch a supervisory communication or to escalate the communication into an MRA on the\nsole basis of an institution\u2019s lack of adoption of an examiner\u2019s suggestion offered in\nmultiple examination cycles. If an institution\u2019s condition deteriorates following a\nsupervisory communication, the circumstances underlying the supervisory\ncommunication could later be the basis for an MRA or enforcement action, but only if the\ncriteria for an MRA or enforcement action under the proposal are satisfied, and not solely\non the basis of failing to respond to the supervisory communication. This framework\nwould allow examiners to share their expertise with management and the board of\ndirectors about potential enhancements while leaving decisions regarding the\nimplementation of any enhancements to the institution.\nIn addition, the agencies would also be permitted to include supervisory\ncommunications in a report of examination to explain changes in ratings. For example, if\na bank is downgraded from a \u201c1\u201d to a \u201c2\u201d in a particular CAMELS component, the\nagency may explain this downgrade, and such an explanation would constitute a\n\u201csupervisory communication.\u201d As noted above, such an explanation would not impose\nany binding requirement on an institution to remediate any weakness identified, and the\n25 agency could not further downgrade the institution solely on the basis of failing to\nremediate such a weakness.\nC. Composite Ratings Downgrades\nThe agencies believe that the changes to the standards for unsafe or unsound\npractices and MRAs in the proposed rule are important to prioritize material financial\nrisks and compliance with banking and banking-related laws and regulations. In\nfurtherance of the agencies\u2019 goal to prioritize attention on material financial risks and\nlegal compliance, the agencies also expect that any downgrade in an institution\u2019s\ncomposite supervisory rating to less-than-satisfactory47 would only occur in\ncircumstances in which the institution receives an MRA that meets the standard outlined\nin the proposed rule or an enforcement action pursuant to the agencies\u2019 enforcement\nauthority, including an enforcement action based on an unsafe or unsound practice as\ndefined in the proposed rule.48 In the case of an insured depository institution, a\ncomposite rating of \u201c3\u201d in the CAMELS rating systems is generally considered \u201cless-\nthan-satisfactory.\u201d49 A downgrade to a less-than-satisfactory composite supervisory\nrating can have significant regulatory and statutory consequences for an institution.50 By\n47 This refers to an institution\u2019s composite rating under the Uniform Financial Institution Rating System\n(UFIRS). Currently, the UFIRS incorporates six individual component ratings: capital, asset quality,\nmanagement, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk. The UFIRS also incorporates a composite\nrating, which functions as an overall assessment of the financial institution. The composite rating generally\nbears a close relationship to the component ratings assigned, but the composite rating is not derived by\ncomputing an arithmetic average of the component ratings. For federal branches and agencies of foreign\nbanks, this refers to the institution\u2019s composite rating under the rating system applicable to federal branches\nand agencies of foreign banks.\n48 The agencies would not necessarily expect to issue a new MRA or take an additional enforcement action\nbefore further downgrades in an institution\u2019s composite rating unless the additional downgrade was based\non new concerns or there is further deterioration in the institution\u2019s condition.\n49 OCC, Comptroller\u2019s Handbook, \u201cBank Supervision Process\u201d at 71.\n50 For example, a less-than-satisfactory composite rating may limit an institution\u2019s ability to engage in\ninterstate mergers, establish a de novo interstate branch, or control or hold an interest in certain\nsubsidiaries. See 12 U.S.C. 24a, 36(g), 1831u, 1843(m).\n26 connecting the assignment of a less-than-satisfactory composite rating to the issuance of\nMRAs and enforcement actions, the agencies would generally ensure a less-than-\nsatisfactory composite rating is tied to a potential material harm to the institution\u2019s\nfinancial condition, potential material risk of loss to the DIF, actual material harm to the\ninstitution\u2019s financial condition, or actual violations of certain laws and regulations.\nAlthough section 8 of the FDI Act provides for grounds for an enforcement action based\non a violation of law, the agencies expect that they would not downgrade an institution\u2019s\ncomposite rating to less-than-satisfactory based only on a violation of law, unless such\npractice, act, or failure to act that results in the violation of law also is likely to cause\nmaterial harm to the financial condition of the institution, is likely to present a material\nrisk of loss to the DIF, or has caused material harm to the institution\u2019s financial\ncondition, as the agencies propose under the unsafe or unsound practice definition.\nIII. Request for Comments\nThe agencies request feedback on all aspects of the proposed rule, including:\nQuestion 1: What effect would the proposed rule have on the agencies\u2019 ability to\naddress misconduct by institutions under their enforcement and supervisory authority?\nWhat effect would the proposed rule have on the agencies\u2019 ability to address misconduct\nby institution-affiliated parties under their enforcement and supervisory authority?\nQuestion 2: Does the proposed definition of unsafe or unsound practice\nappropriately capture the types of objectionable practices, acts, or failures to act that\nshould be captured? Please explain.\nQuestion 3: Does the proposed definition of unsafe or unsound practice provide\nthe agencies with adequate authority to proactively address risks that could cause a\n27 precipitous decline in an institution\u2019s financial condition, such as a liquidity event or a\ncybersecurity incident?\nQuestion 4: Other than \u201cmaterial,\u201d are there terms that the agencies should\nconsider to specify the magnitude of the risk required for a practice, act, or failure to act,\nto be considered an unsafe or unsound practice, e.g. \u201cabnormal,\u201d \u201csignificant,\u201d or\n\u201cundue\u201d?\nQuestion 5: Is \u201clikely\u201d the appropriate standard to specify the probability of risk\nrequired for a practice, act, or failure to act, to be considered an unsafe or unsound\npractice? Is another term more appropriate, e.g. \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d \u201ccould\nreasonably,\u201d \u201cimminent,\u201d \u201cabnormal probability?\u201d Should the agencies specify a\nminimum percentage of likelihood? If so, what would be an appropriate minimum\npercentage of likelihood? Should the agencies consider a standard that does not imply an\nassessment of a forward-looking probability?\nQuestion 6: Should the agencies consider specifying one or more quantitative\nmeasurements to define or exemplify \u201cmaterial harm\u201d to the financial condition of the\ninstitution?\nQuestion 7: Should the agencies define \u201cmaterially\u201d in the regulation? If so,\nhow?\nQuestion 8: Should the agencies define harm to the financial condition of an\ninstitution in the regulation? If so, how? Should this include specific indicators or\nthresholds, or adverse effects to capital, liquidity, or earnings?\nQuestion 9: Section 8 of the FDI Act uses the term \u201cunsafe or unsound practice\u201d\nnumerous times and in different contexts. Should the proposed definition of unsafe or\n28 unsound practice apply to all uses of the term within section 8 of the FDI Act? If not,\nwhat provisions should be excluded? Should the agencies have a uniform definition for\npurposes of section 8, as proposed, or should there be nuances depending on the context?\nQuestion 10: Should the proposed definition of unsafe or unsound practice apply\nto other uses of the term or references to section 8 of the FDI Act within Title 12 of the\nCFR? If so, what provisions should be included? What, if any, effect would the proposed\ndefinition have on the agencies\u2019 ability to engage in rulemaking?\nQuestion 11: Should the proposed definition of unsafe or unsound practice apply\nto uses of the term beyond section 8 of the FDI Act? If yes, what provisions should be\nincluded? For example:\n- Tier 2 and Tier 3 Civil Money Penalty provisions (12 U.S.C. 93, 504, 1817,\n1972).\n- Capital standards in 12 U.S.C. 1464(t).\n- Definition of institution-affiliated party in 12 U.S.C. 1813(u).\n- Grounds for appointing a conservator or receiver in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c)(5).\nQuestion 12: Is the agencies\u2019 use of the term \u201cgenerally accepted standards of\nprudent operations,\u201d as described in this proposal, appropriate for making safety and\nsoundness determinations? Are there are other terms the agencies should consider using\ninstead?\nQuestion 13: Other than \u201ccould reasonably be expected,\u201d are there terms that the\nagencies should consider to specify the probability of risk required for a practice, act, or\nfailure to act, to be communicated as an MRA, e.g. \u201ccould possibly,\u201d \u201ccould\n29 foreseeably,\u201d \u201cwould\u201d? Is this standard sufficiently distinct from the likelihood\nrequirement for unsafe or unsound practices so as to convey a lower bar?\nQuestion 14: The proposal would allow the agencies to issue MRAs based on\n\u201creasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d Is \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d the right standard? As\nan example, at what point in Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s timeline would an MRA for\nweaknesses in interest rate risk management have been (1) appropriate and (2)\npermissible under the proposal? If another standard would be more appropriate, please\nexplain.\nQuestion 15: If the agencies adopt the proposed standard for the issuance of an\nMRA, how should the agencies determine when to close an MRA? Should the agencies\nprovide additional clarity in a final rule? Are there unique verification and validation\nconcerns associated with the proposed standard that the agencies should consider?\nShould verification and validation procedures be tailored for different types of\ninstitutions, considering factors like the sophistication of an institution and the frequency\nof examinations? Should there be a limit (e.g., one or two quarters; one examination\ncycle) to the duration that an MRA may remain open after an institution corrects the\npractice resulting in the MRA? If an MRA is not remediated for a certain period of time,\nwhat steps should the agencies take?\nQuestion 16: Should the proposal provide any clarity around timeframes for\nremediating MRAs? If so, should small institutions (and those with limited resources) be\nprovided with longer timeframes to address MRAs? Should institutions with more severe\nvulnerabilities (such as 5-rated institutions) be provided shorter timeframes?\n30 Question 17: Should the proposed standard for issuing MRAs also apply to\nissuing violations of law? Why or why not? If a different standard should apply, please\ndescribe the standard and explain why. If the agencies did not use MRAs for violations of\nlaw, how should the agencies approach violations of law?\nQuestion 18: Under the proposal, the agencies could cite violations of banking\nand banking-regulated laws or regulations as MRAs. Is \u201cbanking and banking-related\u201d\nthe right universe? Should the agencies provide additional clarity on what constitutes\nbanking and banking-related laws? If so, what should be included? Should the agencies\nlimit the scope of banking and banking-related laws to federal banking and banking-\nrelated law? Why or why not?\nQuestion 19: Should the agencies provide additional clarity on the interplay\nbetween MRAs and CAMELS ratings? If so, how?\nQuestion 20: Should the agencies require any downgrade to a CAMELS\ncomposite rating of 3 or below to be accompanied by an MRA or enforcement action?\nAre there instances in which, for example, general economic conditions or idiosyncratic\nrisk factors could cause financial deterioration without evidence of objectionable\npractices, acts, or failures to act? Could such a provision incentivize issuing more\nMRAs? Please explain.\nQuestion 21: To what extent should the agencies use MRAs to address banks that\nare vulnerable to potential economic or other shocks? For example, before the Federal\nReserve began raising interest rates in 2022, or shortly after it began raising interest\nrates, at what point, if any, would it have been appropriate for a banking agency to issue\nMRAs to institutions that were vulnerable to a rise in interest rates? Does the proposal\n31 appropriately allow MRAs in such cases, if applicable? Under the proposal, are there\nother supervisory tools to address such risks?\nQuestion 22: How should the agencies tailor the framework for community\nbanks? For example, should there be different standards for institutions of different sizes\nand complexity? Please explain.\nQuestion 23: Should the proposal tie material harm to the financial condition of\nan institution more specifically to the impact of a practice, act or failure to act on the\ninstitution\u2019s capital? Should there be a higher standard for large banking organizations\ncompared to all other banking organizations? Should the potential or actual harm to an\ninstitution\u2019s financial condition be tied to the capital standards in the prompt correction\naction framework set forth in 12 U.S.C. 1831o?\nQuestion 24: Should the proposed regulation tie material harm to the financial\ncondition of an institution more specifically to the impact of a practice, act or failure to\nact on the institution\u2019s liquidity? Should there be a threshold for a liquidity event, such as\nan outflow of a hypothetical percentage of an institution\u2019s short-term deposits or other\nshort-term liabilities over a defined period?\nQuestion 25: How should the proposed regulation interact with the Interagency\nGuidelines Establishing Safety and Soundness Standards promulgated under 12 U.S.C.\n1831p-1 (e.g., 12 CFR part 30) (Safety and Soundness Standards)? Should the agencies\nsimilarly revise the Safety and Soundness Standards in a manner consistent with the\nproposed regulation? Should a violation of the Safety and Soundness standards be\nconsidered a violation of banking or banking-related law or regulation for purposes of\nthe proposed regulation?\n32 Question 26: What additional steps should the agencies consider to reform\nsupervision, consistent with the goals of the proposal? The agencies have an extensive\nsupervisory framework including examination manuals, regulations, guidance, and\ninternal procedures governing how banks are supervised. What modifications to these\nvarious documents are warranted? How should the agencies sequence these actions?\nIV. Expected Effects\nAs previously discussed, the agencies propose to revise the framework for\ncommunicating MRAs to supervised insured depository institutions (IDIs) to focus on\npractices, acts, or failures to act that, if continued, could reasonably be expected to, under\ncurrent or reasonably foreseeable conditions, (A) materially harm the financial condition\nof an institution or (B) present a material risk of loss to the DIF, or violations of a\nbanking or banking-related law or regulation. The proposal would provide a consistent\nnationwide standard for the issuance of MRAs to promote greater clarity for IDIs and\nIDI-affiliated parties.\nThis analysis utilizes all regulations and guidance applicable to IDIs supervised\nby the agencies, as well as information on the financial condition of supervised IDIs as of\nthe quarter ending June 30, 2025, as the baseline to which the effects of the proposed rule\nare estimated.\nScope\nThe proposal, if adopted, would not impose any obligations on supervised IDIs,\nand supervised IDIs would not need to take any action in response to this rule. The\nproposal, if adopted, would require the agencies to revise their current practices regarding\n33 the identification and communication of examination findings. Therefore, the agencies\nwould be the only entities directly affected by the proposal.\nThe proposal would indirectly affect supervised IDIs through examinations and\nreports of examination (ROEs) conducted by the agencies. All IDIs subject to\nexaminations by the agencies as of June 30, 2025 could be indirectly affected proposal.\nOnly a subset of IDIs are examined every year, therefore the proposed rule could\nindirectly affect a subset of supervised IDIs each year.\nCosts and Benefits\nThe following sections discuss qualitatively some indirect benefits and indirect\ncosts of the proposal.\nIndirect Benefits to IDIs\nThe proposal, if adopted, would pose two types of indirect benefits to supervised\nIDIs: 1) reductions in, or more efficient use of, costs to comply with findings from ROEs,\nand 2) possible increases in proceeds from the provision of banking products and\nservices. By raising the standard against which an IDI\u2019s action, or inaction, is assessed to\nbe eligible for an MRA, IDIs may experience lower volumes of examination findings,\nparticularly MRAs. Further, by potentially reducing the number of examination findings\nnot related to material risks to the financial condition of the IDI, the proposed rule may\nenable IDIs that do receive MRAs to more effectively address those risks. Finally, by\nenacting a consistent definition of conditions that merit the use of MRAs across the\nagencies, the proposed rule may improve clarity and reduce uncertainty of ROE findings,\nrelative to the baseline. Such reductions in findings and increases in clarity may reduce\ncompliance costs or increase the efficiency with which compliance costs are expended by\n34 IDIs to respond to ROE findings. The agencies do not have the information necessary to\nquantify such potential indirect benefits.\nNegative feedback from regulators during the examination process may\ndiscourage IDIs from taking part in activity and could result in reduced provision of\nbanking products and services. To the extent that matters requiring the attention of an\ninstitution\u2019s board of directors and management are currently identified and used in a\nway that raises potential chilling effects by, the proposal could result in fewer such\neffects relative to the baseline. A reduction in chilling effects could enable IDIs to\nprovide financial products and services to entities that they would not have otherwise.\nThe FDIC does not have the data necessary to quantify this potential benefit.\nIndirect Costs to IDIs\nIf adopted the proposed rule may reduce the volume of examination findings\ncommunicated to IDIs and this could pose certain indirect costs. To the extent that the\nproposed rule, if adopted, delayed the identification of material risks to the financial\ncondition of an IDI, such entities could incur higher costs to resolve such issues,\nassociated losses, and in extreme cases, failure. However, as previously discussed, the\nagencies believe that proposed definition of unsafe and unsound better prioritizes the\nidentification and communication of such risks. Therefore, the agencies believe that such\ncosts are unlikely to be substantial. Moreover, it is also possible that under the proposal\nrisks to IDIs and risks of IDI failures could decrease significantly, because under the\nproposal IDI management and examiners would prioritize the identification and\nremediation of issues that could result in material financial loss to IDIs.\nV. Alternatives Considered\n35 The agencies considered leaving the current regulatory framework unchanged.\nHowever, as previously discussed, the current methods for communicating certain\nsupervisory examination findings can promote confusion or not appropriately focus\nsupervisory and institution resources on the most critical financial risks to institutions and\nthe financial system. Therefore, the agencies believe that the proposal is more\nappropriate.\nVI. Regulatory Analyses\nPaperwork Reduction Act\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 199551 (PRA) states that no agency may\nconduct or sponsor, nor is the respondent required to respond to, an information\ncollection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\ncontrol number. The agencies have reviewed this proposed rule and determined that it\ndoes not create any information collection or revise any existing collection of\ninformation. Accordingly, no PRA submissions to OMB will be made with respect to this\nproposed rule.\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act52 (RFA) requires an agency to consider the impact\nof its proposed rules on small entities. In connection with a proposed rule, the RFA\ngenerally requires an agency to prepare an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA)\ndescribing the impact of the rule on small entities, unless the head of the agency certifies\nthat the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial\nnumber of small entities and publishes such certification along with a statement providing\n51 44 U.S.C. 3501\u20133521.\n52 Id.\n36 the factual basis for such certification in the Federal Register. An IRFA must contain: (1)\na description of the reasons why action by the agency is being considered; (2) a succinct\nstatement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the proposed rule; (3) a description of\nand, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities to which the proposed\nrule will apply; (4) a description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other\ncompliance requirements of the proposed rule, including an estimate of the classes of\nsmall entities that will be subject to the requirements and the type of professional skills\nnecessary for preparation of the report or record; (5) an identification, to the extent\npracticable, of all relevant Federal rules that may duplicate, overlap with, or conflict with\nthe proposed rule; and (6) a description of any significant alternatives to the proposed\nrule that accomplish its stated objectives.\n1. OCC\nThe OCC currently supervises 1,012 institutions (commercial banks, trust\ncompanies, Federal savings associations, and branches or agencies of foreign banks),53 of\nwhich approximately 609 are small entities under the RFA.54\nIn general, the OCC classifies the economic impact on an individual small entity\nas significant if the total estimated impact in one year is greater than 5 percent of the\nsmall entity\u2019s total annual salaries and benefits or greater than 2.5 percent of the small\n53 Based on data accessed using the OCC\u2019s Financial Institutions Data Retrieval System on September 8,\n2025.\n54 The OCC bases its estimate of the number of small entities on the Small Business Administration\u2019s size\nthresholds for commercial banks and savings institutions, and trust companies, which are $850 million and\n$47 million, respectively. Consistent with the General Principles of Affiliation, 13 CFR 121.103(a), the\nOCC counted the assets of affiliated financial institutions when determining if it should classify an OCC-\nsupervised institution as a small entity. The OCC used average quarterly assets in December 31, 2024 to\ndetermine size because a \u201cfinancial institution\u2019s assets are determined by averaging the assets reported on\nits four quarterly financial statements for the preceding year.\u201d See footnote 8 of the U.S. Small Business\nAdministration\u2019s Table of Size Standards.\n37 entity\u2019s total non-interest expense. Furthermore, the OCC considers 5 percent or more of\nOCC-supervised small entities to be a substantial number, and at present, 30 OCC-\nsupervised small entities would constitute a substantial number. Therefore, since the\nproposed rule would affect all OCC-supervised institutions, a substantial number of\nOCC-supervised small entities would be impacted.\nThis proposed rulemaking imposes no new mandates, and thus no direct costs, on\naffected OCC-supervised institutions. Therefore, the proposed rule would not have a\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n2. FDIC\nGenerally, the FDIC considers a significant economic impact to be a quantified\neffect in excess of 5 percent of total annual salaries and benefits or 2.5 percent of total\nnoninterest expenses. The FDIC believes that effects in excess of one or more of these\nthresholds typically represent significant economic impacts for FDIC-insured institutions.\nThe FDIC believes that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small entities55 because the proposed rule will not pose\nreporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements56 on small, FDIC-supervised\nIDIs. However, the proposed rule could present significant indirect benefits to small,\nFDIC-supervised IDIs. Therefore, the FDIC is presenting an Initial Regulatory\nFlexibility Act Analysis in this section.\n55 SBA defines a small banking organization as having $850 million or less in assets, where an\norganization\u2019s \u201cassets are determined by averaging the assets reported on its four quarterly financial\nstatements for the preceding year.\u201d See 13 CFR 121.201 (as amended by 87 FR 69118, effective December\n19, 2022). In its determination, the \u201cSBA counts the receipts, employees, or other measure of size of the\nconcern whose size is at issue and all of its domestic and foreign affiliates.\u201d See 13 CFR 121.103.\nFollowing these regulations, the FDIC uses an insured depository institution\u2019s affiliated and acquired\nassets, averaged over the preceding four quarters, to determine whether the insured depository institution is\n\u201csmall\u201d for the purposes of the RFA.\n56 5 U.S.C. 603(b)(4)\n38 Reasons Why This Action Is Being Considered\nThe lack of a consistent nationwide standard about the scope of the term unsafe or\nunsound practice, as interpreted by the courts, has caused uncertainty for institutions and\ninstitution-affiliated parties.57 The proposed regulatory definition would provide a\nconsistent nationwide standard to reduce burden and provide greater clarity for\ninstitutions and institution-affiliated parties.\nPolicy Objectives\nThe policy objectives are to promote greater clarity and certainty regarding\nenforcement and supervision standards so that examiners and IDIs prioritize material\nfinancial risks to IDIs and avoid unnecessary regulatory burden.\nLegal Basis\nPursuant to the provisions of section 8 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818), the FDIC\nis authorized to take enforcement actions against depository institutions,58 and institution-\naffiliated parties59 that have engaged in an \u201cunsafe or unsound practice.\u201d Under this\nauthority, the FDIC is proposing to define by regulation the term \u201cunsafe or unsound\npractice\u201d for purposes of section 8 of the FDI Act. For a more detailed discussion of the\nproposed rule\u2019s legal basis please refer to section A. Unsafe or Unsound Practices, within\nSection II of the preamble.\n57 See, e.g., Calcutt v. FDIC, 37 F.4th 293, 325 (6th Cir. 2022), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 598 U.S. 623\n(2023) (citing Seidman, 37 F.3d at 926\u201327) (\u201c[Twelve U.S.C. 1818] does not define an \u2018unsafe or unsound\npractice,\u2019 and the term is interpreted flexibly.\u201d); id. at 353\u201357 (Murphy, J., dissenting) (discussing circuit\nsplit and reliance on legislative history as opposed to plain text); see also Greene Cnty. Bank, 92 F.3d at\n636.\n58 A depository institution generally refers to an insured depository institution as defined in 12 U.S.C.\n1813(c)(2); any national banking association chartered by the OCC, including an uninsured association; or\na branch or agency of a foreign bank. Refer to specific provisions of 12 U.S.C. 1818 regarding their\napplicability to a specific institution. See 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(4)\u2013(5).\n59 See id. 1813(u).\n39 Description of the Rule\nThe agencies propose implementing a definition of unsafe or unsound practice for\npurposes of section 8 of the FDI Act that would focus on material risks to the financial\ncondition of an IDI and require the likelihood that an imprudent practice, act, or\nomission, if continued, would pose a material risk to the IDI\u2019s financial condition. The\nagencies are also proposing to establish uniform standards for examiners\u2019 communication\nof MRAs. Under the proposed rule, an examiner would be permitted to issue an MRA to\naddress certain risks to the financial condition of an institution. For a more detailed\ndescription of the proposal please refer to section A. Unsafe or Unsound Practices, within\nSection II of the preamble.\nSmall Entities Affected\nThe proposal, if adopted, would not impose any obligations on small, FDIC-\nsupervised entities, and supervised entities would not need to take any action in response\nto this rule. The proposal, if adopted, would require the FDIC to revise their current\npractices regarding the communication of IDI examination findings. Therefore, the FDIC\nwould be the only entity directly affected by the proposal.\nThe proposal would indirectly affect small, FDIC-supervised IDIs through\nexaminations and reports of examinations conducted by the agencies. As of the quarter\nending June 30, 2025, the FDIC supervised 2,808 IDIs, of which 2,085 are small entities\nfor the purposes of the RFA.60 Only a subset of small, FDIC-supervised IDIs are\nexamined every year, therefore the proposed rule could indirectly affect a subset of small,\nFDIC-supervised IDIs each year.\n60 FDIC Call Report Data, June 30, 2025.\n40 Cost and Benefits\nTo estimate the expected effects of the proposal, this analysis considers all\nrelevant regulations and guidance applicable to these institutions, as well as information\non the financial condition of all IDIs as of the quarter ending June 30, 2025.\nThe proposal, if adopted, would pose two types of indirect benefits to small,\nFDIC-supervised IDIs: 1) reductions in, or more efficient use of, costs to comply with\nfindings from ROEs, and 2) possible increases in proceeds from the provision of banking\nproducts and services. By raising the standard against which an IDI\u2019s action, or inaction,\nis assessed to be eligible for an MRA, IDIs may experience lower volumes of\nexamination findings, particularly MRAs. Further, by potentially reducing the number of\nexamination findings not related to material risks to the financial condition of the IDI, the\nproposed rule may enable IDIs that do receive MRAs to more effectively address those\nrisks. Finally, by enacting a consistent definition of conditions that merit the use of\nMRAs across agencies the proposed rule may improve clarity and reduce uncertainty of\nROE findings, relative to the baseline. Such reductions in findings and increases in\nclarity may reduce compliance costs or increase the efficiency with which compliance\ncosts are expended by IDIs to respond to ROE findings. The agencies do not have the\ninformation necessary to quantify such potential indirect benefits.\nNegative feedback from regulators during the examination process may\ndiscourage IDIs from taking part in activity and could result in reduced provision of\nbanking products and services. To the extent that matters requiring the attention of an\ninstitution\u2019s board of directors and management are currently identified and used in a\nway that raises potential chilling effects by, the proposal could result in fewer such\n41 effects relative to the baseline. A reduction in chilling effects could enable IDIs to\nprovide financial products and services to entities that they would not have otherwise.\nThe FDIC does not have the data necessary to quantify this potential benefit. Moreover, it\nis also possible that under the proposal risks to small, FDIC-supervised IDIs and risks of\nIDI failures could decrease significantly, because under the proposal IDI management\nand examiners would prioritize the identification and remediation of issues that could\nresult in material financial loss to IDIs.\nFDIC cannot quantitatively estimate the indirect effects that small, FDIC-\nsupervised IDIs are likely to incur if the proposed rule were adopted. However, in the\nfour quarters ending June 30th, 2025, 5 percent of total annual salaries and benefits or 2.5\npercent of total noninterest expenses amounts to $139,850 and $124,175, respectively, for\nthe median small, FDIC-supervised institution.61 The indirect benefits that a small,\nFDIC-supervised institution could realize as a result of the proposed rule would depend\non changes in the volume of findings of examination and the compliance costs to address\nthose examination findings, relative to the baseline. The proposed rule would establish a\ndefinition of unsafe or unsound that would result in issuances of MRAs only where a\npractice, act, or failure to act that, if continued, could reasonably be expected to, under\ncurrent or reasonably foreseeable conditions, materially harm the financial condition of\nan institution. The FDIC believes that it is plausible that the proposed rule, if adopted,\ncould pose indirect benefits to FDIC-supervised IDIs that exceed $139,850 and $124,175\na year for a substantial number of small, FDIC-supervised IDIs.\n61 FDIC Call Report Data, June 30, 2025.\n42 The FDIC invites comments on all aspects of the supporting information provided\nin this RFA section, and in particular, whether the proposed rule would have any\nsignificant effects on small entities that the FDIC has not identified?\nOCC Unfunded Mandates Reform Act\nThe OCC has analyzed the proposed rule under the factors in the Unfunded\nMandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA).62 Under this analysis, the OCC considered\nwhether the proposed rule includes a Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure\nby State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100\nmillion or more in any one year ($187 million as adjusted annually for inflation).\nPursuant to section 202 of the UMRA,63 if a proposed rule meets this UMRA threshold,\nthe OCC would need to prepare a written statement that includes, among other things, a\ncost-benefit analysis of the proposal. The UMRA does not apply to regulations that\nincorporate requirements specifically set forth in law.\nThis proposed rulemaking imposes no new mandates\u2014and thus no direct costs\u2014\non affected OCC-supervised institutions. The OCC, therefore, concludes that the\nproposed rule would not result in an expenditure of $187 million or more annually by\nstate, local, and tribal governments, or by the private sector. Accordingly, the OCC has\nnot prepared the written statement described in section 202 of the UMRA.\nRiegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994\nPursuant to section 302(a) of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory\nImprovement Act of 1994, 12 U.S.C. 4802(a), in determining the effective date and\nadministrative compliance requirements for new regulations that impose additional\n62 2 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.\n63 Id. 1532.\n43 reporting, disclosure, or other requirements on insured depository institutions, the\nagencies will consider, consistent with principles of safety and soundness and the public\ninterest: (1) any administrative burdens that the proposed rule would place on depository\ninstitutions, including small depository institutions and customers of depository\ninstitutions; and (2) the benefits of the proposed rule. The agencies request comment on\nany administrative burdens that the proposed rule would place on depository institutions,\nincluding small depository institutions, and their customers, and the benefits of the\nproposed rule that the agencies should consider in determining the effective date and\nadministrative compliance requirements for a final rule.\nProviding Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023\nThe Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023, 12 U.S.C.\n553(b)(4), requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking include the internet address of a\nsummary of not more than 100 words in length of a proposed rule, in plain language, that\nshall be posted on the internet website www.regulations.gov.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation propose to define the term \u201cunsafe or unsound practice\u201d for purposes of 12\nU.S.C. 1818 and to revise the supervisory framework for the issuance of Matters\nRequiring Attention and other supervisory communications.\nThe proposal and the required summary can be found at\nhttps:\/\/www.regulations.gov by searching for Docket ID OCC-2025-0174 and\nhttps:\/\/occ.gov\/topics\/laws-and-regulations\/occ-regulations\/proposed-issuances\/index-\nproposed-issuances.html.\nExecutive Order 12866\n44 Executive Order 12866, titled \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review,\u201d as amended,\nrequires the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), Office of\nManagement and Budget to determine whether a proposed rule is a \u201csignificant\nregulatory action\u201d prior to the disclosure of the proposed rule to the public. If OIRA finds\nthe proposed rule to be a \u201csignificant regulatory action,\u201d Executive Order 12866 requires\nthe agencies to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed rule and for OIRA to\nconduct a review of the proposed rule prior to publication in the Federal Register.\nExecutive Order 12866 defines \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d to mean a regulatory\naction that is likely to (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more\nor adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,\ncompetition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal\ngovernments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere\nwith an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary\nimpact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of\nrecipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates,\nthe President\u2019s priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.\nOIRA has determined that this proposed rule is a significant regulatory action\nunder Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, is subject to review under Executive Order\n12866. The agencies\u2019 analysis conducted in connection with Executive Order 12866 is set\nforth below.\n1. OCC\nThe OCC currently supervises 1,012 national banks, federal savings associations,\ntrust companies and branches and agencies of foreign banks (collectively, banks). This\n45 proposed rule would apply to all OCC-supervised institutions. The OCC expects that\nOCC-supervised institutions would have both direct and indirect benefits as well as\nindirect costs as a result of this proposal.\nSpecifically, the proposed rule would result in several direct benefits to OCC-\nsupervised institutions, namely, significant cost and time savings to institutions because\nthey would have fewer MRA issuances and enforcement actions (collectively, issues) to\naddress going forward. Banks can incur significant direct costs arising from issues. For\nexample, some banks hire external consultants, for which hourly rates can range from\nbetween $300 and $1,200 an hour for top tier firms64,65 to $150 to $300 an hour for lower\ntier firms. And financial advisory firms may charge $250 to $550 per hour.66,67 To the\nextent that there may be less need for consultants, banks will directly benefit from\nconsultant cost savings.\nIn addition to consultant fees, banks incur other direct costs to successfully\naddress issues and pay any associated penalties. These costs may include increased hiring\nand retention of appropriately qualified employees, training for existing employees, time\nexpenditure of employees (which may include time spent addressing the underlying issue,\ntime by management and the board to review and approve changes made, time spent\n64 See Clancy Fossum, Embark, What Are The Fees & Hourly Rates Of Accounting Consulting Firms?\n(Nov. 13, 2019), https:\/\/blog.embarkwithus.com\/what-are-the-fees-hourly-rates-of-accounting-consulting-\nfirms#:~:text=in%20each%20category.-\n,Big%204%20Firms,global%20footprints%2C%20and%20charge%20accordingly.&text=Although%20Bi\ng%204%20fees%20in,be%20aware%20of%20before%20proceeding.\n65 See Consulting Mavericks, Average Consulting Rates By Industry,\nhttps:\/\/consultingmavericks.com\/start\/other\/average-consulting-rates-by-industry\/ (last visited Sept. 26,\n2025).\n66 Note, these price ranges are as of 2019 economy prices.\n67 Financial advisory firms offer a wide range of services to clients that could be useful for MRA\nremediation. However, they typically do not provide traditional accounting services and do not sign off on\nopinions or certifications the way accounting firms do.\n46 working with external consultants, time conducting internal audit verification, and time\nspent in partnership with the OCC in ongoing follow up communications and possibly\nexaminations specific to the issue), updating processes and procedures, and addressing\nthe underlying issue itself. If the issue has to do with bank systems or infrastructure, these\ncosts could include technology costs, which could be very costly expenditures. If banks\ndo not remediate issues in a timely fashion, they may also incur additional fines and\npenalties on top of the costs to remediate the issue itself. 68,69\nWhile it would be difficult to precisely quantify the overall aggregate annual\ndirect cost savings to OCC supervised institutions, the OCC expects that this proposal\nwould result in an immediate and material cost savings to affected institutions, easily\nranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars saved annually in aggregate. In\naddition to the significant direct cost savings from no longer needing to address issues,\nbanks could potentially experience several indirect benefits, including clarity and\nconsistency regarding MRA or enforcement concerns and less staffing turnover.\nRegarding direct costs, this proposed rulemaking imposes no new mandates, and\nthus no direct costs, on affected OCC-supervised institutions. Regarding indirect costs,\nfewer issues may lead to delayed identification of material risks, which could include\nhigher costs to resolve such issues, associated losses, and in extreme cases, failure.\nNevertheless, those risks should be low because the proposed definition endeavors to\n68 See Perry Menezes et al., CSO Online, How Financial Institutions Can Reduce Security and Other Risks\nfrom MRAs | CSO Online (Aug. 29, 2023), https:\/\/www.csoonline.com\/article\/650386\/how-financial-\ninstitutions-can-reduce-security-and-other-risks-from-\nmras.html#:~:text=MRAs%20are%20expensive,has%20not%20done%20its%20job.\n69 According to a 2021 survey by Better Market, the largest U.S. banks have incurred almost $200 billion in\naggregate fines and penalties over the previous 20 years from the time of the survey. See BIP. Monticello\nConsulting Group, Building Regulatory Resilience: A Deeper Look into Consent Orders & MRAs (Apr. 20,\n2021), https:\/\/www.monticellocg.com\/blog\/2021\/04\/20\/building-regulatory-resilience-a-deeper-look-into-\nconsent-orders-mras#_ftn2.\n47 more effectively prioritize the identification of material financial risks (i.e., those most\nlikely to cause significant stress) and therefore to lower the risk of bank failure.\nAccordingly, it is also possible that under the proposal risks to banks and risks of bank\nfailures could decrease significantly, because under the proposal bank management and\nbank examiners would prioritize the identification and remediation of issues that could\nresult in material financial loss to banks. Ultimately, the net effect will be dependent\nupon agency policies and oversight and responses by bank management to this proposal.\nOverall, the OCC expects that the combined effects of the proposed rule\u2019s\nchanges to result in net direct impact of a significant cost savings to all OCC-supervised\ninstitutions, easily ranging from hundreds of millions to several billion dollars in\naggregate. There are also no explicit mandates in the proposal for affected institutions.\nHow the proposal is executed and bank responses to the execution will ultimately\ndetermine the net impact over the longer term.\n2. FDIC\nThis analysis utilizes all regulations and guidance applicable to FDIC-supervised\nIDIs, as well as information on the financial condition of IDIs as of the quarter ending\nJune 30, 2025, as the baseline to which the effects of the proposed rule are estimated.\nScope\nThe proposal, if adopted, would not impose any obligations on FDIC-supervised\nIDIs, and supervised IDIs would not need to take any action in response to this rule. The\nproposal, if adopted, would require the FDIC to revise their current practices regarding\nthe identification and communication of examination findings. Therefore, the FDIC\nwould be the only entity directly affected by the proposal.\n48 The proposal would indirectly affect FDIC-supervised IDIs through examinations\nconducted by the FDIC, and the resulting ROEs. All FDIC-supervised IDIs are subject to\nexamination by the FDIC. As of the quarter ending June 30, 2025, the FDIC supervised\n2,808 IDIs.70 However, only a subset of IDIs are examined every year, therefore the\nproposed rule could indirectly affect a subset of FDIC-supervised IDIs each year.\nAnnual Effect on the Economy or Adverse Effect\nThe proposal, if adopted, would pose two types of indirect benefits to FDIC-\nsupervised IDIs: 1) reductions in, or more efficient use of, costs to comply with findings\nfrom ROEs, and 2) possible increases in proceeds from the provision of banking products\nand services. By raising the standard against which an FDIC-supervised IDI\u2019s action, or\ninaction, is assessed to be eligible for an MRA, IDIs may experience lower volumes of\nexamination findings, particularly MRAs. Further, by potentially reducing the number of\nexamination findings not related to material risks to the financial condition of the IDI, the\nproposed rule may enable IDIs that do receive MRAs to more effectively address those\nrisks. Finally, by enacting a consistent definition of conditions that merit the use of\nMRAs across the agencies, the proposed rule may improve clarity and reduce uncertainty\nof ROE findings, relative to the baseline. Such reductions in findings and increases in\nclarity may reduce compliance costs or increase the efficiency with which compliance\ncosts are expended by FDIC-supervised IDIs to respond to ROE findings. The FDIC\ndoes not have the information necessary to quantify such potential indirect benefits.\nNegative feedback from regulators during the examination process may\ndiscourage FDIC-supervised IDIs from taking part in activity and could result in reduced\n70 FDIC Call Report data, June 30, 2025.\n49 provision of banking products and services. To the extent that matters requiring the\nattention of an institution\u2019s board of directors and management are currently identified\nand used in a way that raises potential chilling effects, the proposal could result in fewer\nsuch effects relative to the baseline. A reduction in chilling effects could enable FDIC-\nsupervised IDIs to provide financial products and services to entities that they would not\nhave otherwise. The FDIC does not have the data necessary to quantify this potential\nbenefit. Moreover, it is also possible that under the proposal risks to IDIs and risks of IDI\nfailures could decrease significantly, because under the proposal IDI management and\nexaminers would prioritize the identification and remediation of issues that could result in\nmaterial financial loss to IDIs.\nIf adopted the proposed rule may reduce the volume of examination findings\ncommunicated to FDIC-supervised IDIs and this could pose certain indirect costs. To the\nextent that the proposed rule, if adopted, delayed the identification of material risks to the\nfinancial condition of an IDI, such entities could incur higher costs to resolve such issues,\nassociated loses, and in extreme cases, failure. However, as previously discussed, the\nFDIC believe that the proposed definition of unsafe and unsound better prioritizes the\nidentification and communication of such risks. Therefore, the FDIC believe that such\ncosts are unlikely to be substantial.\nFDIC cannot quantitatively estimate the indirect effects that FDIC-supervised\nIDIs are likely to incur if the proposed rule were adopted. However, assuming that all\nFDIC-supervised IDIs are subject to a bank examination once every 18 months the\nproposed rule would only need to pose $53,419 in indirect benefits, on average, to FDIC-\n50 supervised IDIs to result in an annual economic effect in excess of $100 million.71 Based\non the preceding analysis the FDIC believes that the proposed regulatory action could\nplausibly result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. However,\nthe FDIC does not believe that the proposed rule will adversely affect in a material way\nthe economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,\npublic health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.\nSerious Inconsistency\nThe FDIC does not believe the proposed regulatory action would create a serious\ninconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency.\nCurrently, the FDIC and OCC use distinct terminology to identify and communicate\ndeficiencies that rise to the level of a matter that requires attention from an institution\u2019s\nboard of directors and management. The agencies are proposing to jointly revise the\nterminology and thresholds for the issuance of MRAs in their supervisory programs.\nTherefore, the FDIC believes that this regulatory action would not create a serious\ninconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency,\nbut rather would remove existing inconsistencies.\nMaterial Alternation\nThe FDIC does not believe the proposed regulatory action would materially alter\nthe budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and\nobligations of recipients thereof. The proposed regulatory action does nothing to alter\nentitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of the\nrecipients of such programs.\n71 $100,000,000 \/ (2,808 \/ 1.5) = $53,418.80.\n51 Novel Legal or Policy Issues\nThe FDIC does not believe the proposed regulatory action would raise novel legal\nor policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President\u2019s priorities, or the principles\nset forth in Executive Order 12866. The FDIC has experience in conducting\nexaminations of the safety and soundness of IDIs and communicating their findings in a\nvariety of ways since its inception. Further, IDIs have an existing mandate to operate in a\nsafe and sound manner.72 Therefore, this proposed regulatory action does not raise any\nnovel legal or policy issues.\nExecutive Order 14192\nExecutive Order 14192, titled \u2018\u2018Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,\u2019\u2019 requires\nthat an agency, unless prohibited by law, identify at least 10 existing regulations to be\nrepealed when the agency publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise\npromulgates a new regulation with total costs greater than zero. Executive Order 14192\nfurther requires that new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the\nextent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at\nleast ten prior regulations. The agencies anticipate that the proposed rule will not be a\nregulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 14192.\nList of Subjects\n12 CFR Part 4\nAdministrative practice and procedure, Freedom of information, Individuals with\ndisabilities, Minority businesses, Organization and functions (Government agencies),\nReporting and recordkeeping requirements, Women.\n72 12 CFR 364 establishes standards for safety and soundness for supervised institutions.\n52 12 CFR Part 305\nBanks, Banking; Organization and functions (Government agencies).\nDEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\n12 CFR Chapter I\nAuthority and Issuance\nFor the reasons set out in the preamble, the OCC proposes to amend chapter I of\ntitle 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:\nPART 4\u2014ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS, AVAILABILITY AND\nRELEASE OF INFORMATION, CONTRACTING OUTREACH PROGRAM,\nPOST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS FOR SENIOR EXAMINERS\n1.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-96 | October 7, 2025 Comptroller Issues Statement on Areas of Focus as FDIC Board Member Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould issued the following statement today at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (FDIC) board meeting about his areas of focus in his capacity as an FDIC board member: Thank you for the warm welcome to the FDIC board. I am very excited to work with Acting FDIC Chairman Hill and Director Vought to advance the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda on matters both interagency and FDIC-specific. With respect to the former, we will be considering several interagency initiatives today in which the OCC and FDIC teams worked collaboratively and that exemplify how the interagency process works best. With respect to FDIC-specific matters, I intend to focus on and look forward to working with the Acting Chairman on the following areas: 1. Rebuilding resolution execution capabilities. I want to distinguish specifically here between resolution \u00e2\u0080\u009cexecution\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094the ability to take actions that facilitate orderly resolution\u00e2\u0080\u0094and resolution \u00e2\u0080\u009cplanning\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094the hypothetical exercise of how an organization would or should fail. I am skeptical of the efficacy of the latter as well as, in some cases, the legality of related agency requirements and expectations. On the other hand, resolution execution is one of the FDIC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core functions, and I will be focused on ensuring that the FDIC has the capabilities to carry out these core functions effectively. Relatedly, and as I have previously said in Congressional testimony following the bank failures of 2023, I believe greater transparency into the FDIC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions during that time should inform our efforts to improve its resolution execution in the future. 2. Clarifying the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to the management of the Deposit Insurance Fund. The methodologies employed by the agency to calculate insurance premiums or determine ratings that affect premiums, whether in the ordinary course or for special assessments, have, at times, lacked clarity and have spawned litigation, gaming or both. Insurance premiums should be clear, fair, and designed to limit market distortions. 3. Addressing remaining issues around agency culture. I know the FDIC has already taken a number of steps under Acting Chairman Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership to address these past abuses and restore a culture of accountability. I look forward to supporting his continued reform efforts. 4. Reforming the FDIC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s process for evaluating deposit insurance applications. The agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach since the Financial Crisis has been an impediment to the chartering of new banks in this country. This needs to change if we want to restore a dynamic banking system. As the statutory factors for granting deposit insurance are largely taken into account by the chartering authority, the FDIC should perform a circumscribed review, as it did in the years following the enactment of FDICIA. The OCC is committed to collaborating with the FDIC to align and improve upon our de novo bank application process. It is vitally important for all federal banking agencies to have clear and transparent application processes with established timeframes that are actually followed absent extraordinary circumstances, whether for chartering, deposit insurance, business combinations, or other applications. 5. Supporting state bank preemption rights. Federal preemption is not the exclusive purview of the federal banking system. In the 1997 amendments to the Riegle-Neal Act, Congress put state banks on parity with national banks when it comes to preemption of state laws affecting host state branches. Similarly, state banks benefit from interest rate preemption under Section 27 of the FDI Act. State banks should get the benefit of this federal preemption, and I encourage the FDIC to take additional steps to support these Congressionally-granted rights. 6. Updating our understanding of bank funding. The FDIC, like the OCC, still utilizes funding and deposit categories that do not have clear predictive value when it comes to managing liquidity risk. We should re-examine these antiquated notions and develop a more flexible predictive framework going forward, including for assessments. 7. Supporting community banks. The FDIC supervises more community banks than any other federal banking agency. These institutions are vitally important to our economy and our local communities. For too long, regulation and supervision have been insufficiently tailored for community banks, which has hampered their ability to serve our communities and drive economic growth. The Acting Chairman is already taking steps to deliver relief on this front. I support these efforts, and the OCC is moving in similar fashion. I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence in letting me outline my areas of focus, and I look forward to working with him and Director Vought on these and other matters. I am confident that the FDIC is now back on track under the Acting Chairman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership. Related Link Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-95 | October 6, 2025 OCC Announces Actions to Reduce Regulatory Burden for Community Banks Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced guidance to banks and proposed rulemakings to reduce regulatory burden for community banks. These actions build upon the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued efforts to tailor its regulatory and supervisory frameworks to minimize burden for its regulated institutions and promote economic growth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCommunity banks have an outsized impact on lending and are vital to the strength of the U.S. economy. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions relieve these banks of regulatory burden and unproductive reporting requirements, so they are better positioned to support their communities and drive economic growth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe OCC will continue to tailor our risk-based supervision to focus on material financial risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In two bulletins, the OCC clarified examination procedures for community banks. The OCC announced it is removing fixed examination requirements for community banks and instead tailoring the examination scope and frequency to be consistent with risk-based supervision. This approach reduces supervisory burden, maintains the value of the federal charter and preserves banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 safety and soundness while ensuring regulatory oversight does not distract banks from serving their communities. The OCC also announced that it will only use the core assessment standards in the Community Bank Supervision booklet of the Comptroller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Handbook to examine for retail nondeposit investment products. In a separate bulletin, the OCC clarified its expectations that community banks should tailor model risk management practices commensurate with the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk exposures, its business activities, and the complexity and extent of its model use. In particular, the bulletin highlights that the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model risk management guidance does not impose prescriptive requirements, such as annual model validations. The OCC is also considering additional steps to enhance flexibility and reduce burden related to model risk management. This bulletin is just the first step in refining model risk management guidance for all of the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regulated institutions. The OCC also requested comments on two proposed rules. The OCC proposed rescinding its Fair Housing Home Loan Data System regulation, removing largely duplicative data collection requirements for national banks. The proposal would eliminate regulatory burden for banks without having a material impact on the availability of data necessary for the OCC to conduct its fair housing-related supervisory activities. The OCC also proposed broadening eligibility for expedited or reduced licensing procedures to community banks. This proposal would reduce the burden for community banks and tailor requirements to the size and risk profile of an institution. These proposed changes are intended to facilitate an increase in corporate activities and transactions by community banks. The OCC will continue to prioritize reforms targeted to community banks ahead of broader reforms for the industry. Ongoing work includes adjusting the community bank leverage ratio framework and a simplified strategic plan process for community banks to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-94 | October 1, 2025 OCC Releases CRA Performance Evaluations for Six National Banks and Federal Savings Associations Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released a list of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) performance evaluations that became public during the period of September 1, 2025, through September 30, 2025. Under the CRA, the OCC assesses an institution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution.

During this period, lenders are allowed to make these loans without requiring federal flood insurance. As explained in the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance, in Q&A Applicability 12, lenders may continue to make loans without flood insurance coverage during this time but must continue to make flood determinations; provide timely, complete, and accurate notices to borrowers; and comply with other applicable parts of the flood insurance regulations. In addition, lenders should evaluate safety and soundness and legal risks and should prudently manage those risks during the lapse period. The guidance also addresses the availability and use of private flood insurance.

The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. The OCC does not have any enforcement actions against banks to release in September. The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs: Order of Prohibition against Armando De Leon, former Store Manager at a Hialeah, Florida, branch of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, based on the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncontested allegations in the Notice of Charges that, among other things, De Leon submitted fraudulent Payment Protection Program (PPP) loan applications, received over $80,000 in PPP loan proceeds, and used the funds for personal gain. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-35) Order of Prohibition against Carolyn H. Hicks, former Bank Operations Assistant Manager at a Columbus, Georgia, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for misappropriating approximately $25,000 from a bank ATM. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-43) Order of Prohibition against Charron Meadows, former Team Manager at a Mount Laurel, New Jersey, call center of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for misappropriating at least $150,000 from the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-41) Order of Prohibition against Gerald E. Milligan II, former Teller at a Royal Palm, Florida, branch of PNC Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, based on the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncontested allegations in the Notice of Charges that, among other things, Milligan knowingly made false attestations and provided false supporting documentation for a PPP loan application, received PPP loan proceeds in the amount of $141,530, and used the funds for personal gain. (Docket No. AA-EC-2024-12) Order of Prohibition against Walther Riano-Vanegas, former Teller at a Linden, New Jersey, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for stealing $15,670 from two ATMs at the branch. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-40) The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d into a new action. Termination actions include: Order Terminating the Cease and Desist Order against Gateway Bank, F.S.B., Oakland, California, dated November 12, 2020 (Docket No. AA-ENF-2020-69). The terminated order addressed unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to board and management supervision, internal audit, credit administration, and consumer compliance management, and for unsafe or unsound practices and violations of law related to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bank Secrecy Act\/anti-money laundering compliance program. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-47) Order Terminating the Cease and Desist Order against Vast Bank, N.A., Tulsa, Oklahoma, dated October 23, 2023 (Docket No. AA-SO-2023-44). The terminated order addressed unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to capital, capital and strategic planning, project management, books and records, liquidity risk management, interest rate risk management, information technology controls, risk management for new products, and custody account controls.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-89 | September 18, 2025 OCC Announces Updates to Organizational Structure Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced a new organizational framework for bank supervision and updates to the structure of its Office of the Chief National Bank Examiner. Effective October 1, three distinct lines of business will replace the Bank Supervision and Examination group: Large and Global Financial Institutions, Regional and Midsize Financial Institutions, and Community Banks. Each unit will be led by a Senior Deputy Comptroller who will report to the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision and Examination, Greg Coleman, will serve as the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Large and Global Financial Institutions. This group will include financial institutions with assets of over $500 billion and those institutions that have a foreign parent. The Regional and Midsize Financial Institutions group will supervise institutions between $30 and $500 billion in asset size and the Community Bank group will supervise institutions with up to $30 billion in assets. Acting Senior Deputy Comptrollers for these new lines of business will be selected in early October. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis realignment is consistent with our historic risk-based supervision approach and my commitment to tailor supervision to bank risk profile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver time, I expect these three bank supervision groups to generally align with our tailored regulatory framework. This new structure benefits the institutions we supervise and improves the management of examiner resources and supports examiner development and professional growth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition, the Office of the Chief National Bank Examiner will be composed of five divisions that will report to Senior Deputy Comptroller and Chief National Bank Examiner Jay Gallagher. The divisions have been streamlined under the following: Deputy Comptroller for Supervision Systems and Analytical Support; Deputy Comptroller for Credit Risk; Deputy Comptroller for Compliance and Operational Risk; Chief Economist and Deputy Comptroller for Economics; and Chief Accountant and Deputy Comptroller for Capital, Market Risk and Asset Management. The Office of Financial Technology will report directly to Senior Deputy Comptroller and Chief National Bank Examiner Gallagher. All of these organizational updates will better enable the OCC to ensure that national banks and federal savings institutions support their customers, communities and a thriving economy.

    "cleaned_text":"Remarks of Jonathan V. Gould\nComptroller of the Currency\nFinancial Stability Oversight Council\nSeptember 10, 2025\nAt the OCC, we are focused on resetting the risk tolerance for the federal banking system\nand, by extension, the banking system as a whole. Following the 2008 financial crisis, we\nimplemented a regulatory and supervisory framework that sought to micromanage bank\nbalance sheets and activities, and to reduce much of the examination process to a compliance\nexercise focused on procedural box-checking. This low risk tolerance raises the specter of a\nstagnant and increasingly irrelevant banking system. This has implications for our financial\nstability.\nLikewise, we often pursued risk elimination rather than risk management strategies. But risk\nelimination presupposes control over a closed system. Regulators are not omnipotent, nor is\nthe banking system closed. On the contrary, confronted with this risk-intolerant regulatory\nposture, many activities and exposures have flowed out of the banking sector since 2008 and\ninto the larger financial services system. The risk did not go away, and the banking sector\ngrew weaker and less dynamic.\nWe were offered the false choice between economic growth and financial stability. We\ndelivered neither. To the contrary, financial stability depends upon economic growth, as\nDeputy Assistant Secretary Skinner has discussed.\nThe federal banking system comprises almost two-thirds of total U.S. commercial banking\nassets. As its administrator, it is my job to set a risk tolerance through chartering, regulation,\nand supervision that allows the federal banking system to remain relevant and fulfill its\nfunction. In doing so, I take an eyes-wide-open approach to risk management that extends beyond the immediate time horizon and recognizes that the banking system is one part of a\ndynamic financial whole.\nTo that end, the OCC is reviewing the entire post-2008 chartering, regulatory, and\nsupervisory framework. We will be making adjustments where Congress has given us the\ndiscretion to do so consistent with the views I have just expressed.\nTo address each of our functions in turn:\n\u2022 On chartering, I have recently elevated the stature of our chartering and licensing\nfunction within the agency to reflect its strategic importance as gatekeeper of the federal\nbanking system. This will allow me to ensure policy is set at the senior most levels of the\nagency and decisions are made quickly \u2013 including on de novo charters and bank mergers\nand acquisitions, where we will no longer have a de facto \u201cno\u201d policy. I will set policy in this\narea to ensure our federal banking system is no longer stagnant and remains diverse in nature\nand dynamic in scope of activities. As announced earlier this week, we are also using our\nlicensing process as a means to scrutinize and address debanking issues consistent with the\nPresident\u2019s executive order.\n\u2022 On regulation, we will be focusing on capital and liquidity reforms with the other\nbanking agencies. Our current approaches are far too complex and opaque, which frustrates\naccountability and impedes action in a crisis, such as what we encountered in March 2020.\nWe will also be moving to address the regulatory framework for national banks specifically,\nincluding reassessing the need for things like recovery planning and heightened standards.\nWherever possible, we will look to tailor regulations consistent with the letter and spirit of\nthe 2018 Economic Growth Act. We will focus first on community banks, including making\nchanges to the community bank leverage ratio framework and raising applicable regulatory\nasset thresholds where we have discretion to do so. We are also engaged in efforts with other\nbanking agencies to eliminate the use of reputation risk and define key supervisory concepts,\nlike unsafe and unsound practices, in regulation. This will have the benefit of putting bank\nsupervision on a firmer legal foundation and refocusing it on material financial risks. And\n2 our efforts to implement the GENIUS Act are ongoing. That is an important priority for us,\nand we are acutely focused on the statutory deadlines that Congress has set.\n\u2022 Finally, on supervision, we will tailor bank supervision to reflect our tailored regulatory\nframework. We will prioritize reforms aimed at community banks. Next week, I will be\nspending several days on site with our examiners as they wrap up a community bank\nexamination and deliver feedback to management. This experience will inform ongoing\nefforts at the OCC to revise our examination approaches to community banks for certain\nareas like fair lending, capital, liquidity, the Community Reinvestment Act, and third-party\nrisk management, with an eye to adjusting such approaches to reflect the low risks posed by\ncommunity banking activities. More generally, we have begun reviewing supervisory\nstrategies across banks of all sizes with the goal of eliminating ongoing or targeted\nexamination activities that are not related to material financial risks, thus shrinking the\nburden on banks posed by our exam activities, document information requests, and the like.\nThis will also help ensure we do not miss the things that really matter to a bank\u2019s financial\ncondition, as was the case with the failures in bank supervision at Silicon Valley Bank. We\nwill also be raising concerns of redundant supervision with the other federal banking\nagencies, whether around specific topics like cyber or where other agencies are not\nappropriately deferring to functional regulators as required by law.\nI look forward to working with my colleagues at Treasury under the leadership of Secretary\nBessent and with the other agencies represented around this table to deliver much-needed\nreforms to our financial services system, all working to support the President\u2019s vision and\nagenda. In this way, I hope the OCC will contribute to the financial stability goals of this\nCouncil and the economic growth that is its prerequisite.\n3",

The actions are consistent with the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Executive Order (EO) 14331, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuaranteeing Fair Banking For All Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and affirm that banks should provide access to financial services based on individualized, objective, and risk-based analyses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe OCC is taking steps to end the weaponization of the financial system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are working to root out bank activities that unlawfully debank or discriminate against customers on the basis of political or religious beliefs, or lawful business activities. If and when the OCC identifies such activity, it will take action to end it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a bulletin to banks, the OCC clarifies how it considers politicized or unlawful debanking in certain licensing filings and in assessing banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 records of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Specifically, the OCC considers a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past record and current policies and procedures to avoid engaging in politicized or unlawful debanking when the agency evaluates the applicable statutory and regulatory factors for licensing activities. Debanking considerations are also assessed in determining a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CRA rating. As part of its ongoing review to assess politicized or unlawful debanking and consistent with its tailored and risk-based approach to supervision, the OCC initially requested information from its nine largest regulated institutions regarding their debanking activities. The OCC also updated its online customer complaint website to assist consumer reporting and agency identification of any unlawful debanking by its regulated institutions. The OCC is reviewing its consumer complaint data and data from other government and third-party sources to further refine OCC examination efforts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndividuals may have been targeted and surveilled based on where they shop or what they believe in and, in some cases, unlawfully debanked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gould stated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe OCC will not tolerate the misuse of customer financial records as a political tool. The OCC intends to work with other government agencies to ensure this conduct is identified and addressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a separate bulletin, the OCC reminds financial institutions of the limited circumstances that allow for the release of customer financial records and the proper use of suspicious activity reports. The OCC also encourages its regulated institutions to ensure their policies and procedures align with EO 14331 to avoid unlawful debanking. The OCC is reviewing its approaches to Bank Secrecy Act\/anti-money laundering (BSA\/AML) supervision to ensure they are not contributing to unlawful debanking and will make changes if needed. The OCC also welcomes the opportunity to work with other federal agencies to address any shortcomings in the BSA\/AML regulatory framework more generally. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions build upon the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued efforts to depoliticize banking. Earlier this year, the OCC removed references to reputation risk from its handbooks and guidance documents and it will soon propose a rule removing these same references from its regulations. The OCC will continue to implement EO 14331 to ensure fair access.

The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. The OCC has taken the following actions against banks: Formal Agreement with First National Bank & Trust Company, Clinton, Illinois, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to capital, strategic planning, liquidity, and contingency funding planning. (Docket No. AA-CE-2025-30) The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs: Order of Prohibition against Maricela Galindo Celestino, former Bank Teller at a Trenton, New Jersey, branch of PNC Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for embezzling customer funds and causing loss to the bank of approximately $106,000. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-89) Order of Prohibition against Kyla A. Hartley, former part-time Associate Banker at a Brooklyn, New York, branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Columbus, Ohio, for processing fraudulent over-the-counter check deposits and cash withdrawals from customer accounts causing loss to the bank of approximately $196,000. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-33) Order of Prohibition against Karen Lopez, former Assistant Branch Manager at a Conroe, Texas, branch of First National Bank Texas, Killeen, Texas, for making unauthorized cash withdrawals totaling more than $18,000 from bank customer checking accounts.

Gould today issued the following statement in support of the Executive Order, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuaranteeing Fair Banking For All Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d issued by President Donald J. Trump: Fair access to financial services is a fundamental principle of the U.S. banking system. It is unacceptable for banks to discriminate against any customer on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Executive Order affirms that banks should provide access to financial services based on individualized, objective, and risk-based analyses. The OCC has already taken initial steps to depoliticize the federal banking system consistent with the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Executive Order. Earlier this year, the OCC removed references to reputation risk from its handbooks and guidance documents. Soon it will propose a rule removing these same references from its regulations. The OCC will also commence a review to assess the extent to which the institutions it supervises have or are engaged in politicized or unlawful debanking and take remedial actions if appropriate. The OCC is exploring additional steps to ensure politicized or unlawful debanking is never repeated. Related Link Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V.

The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act requires the agencies to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulatory requirements for their supervised institutions. To facilitate this review, the agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories and are now soliciting comments on their regulations for the three remaining categories: Banking Operations, Capital, and the Community Reinvestment Act. The public has 90 days from publication in the Federal Register to comment on the relevant regulations. The agencies will hold outreach meetings where interested parties may comment on applicable regulatory requirements directly to the agencies. Information about the outreach meetings will be publicized as details are finalized.

Introduction\nSection 2222 of EGRPRA1 requires that not less frequently than once every 10 years, the\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)2 and the agencies3 conduct a review\nof their regulations to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements\nimposed on insured depository institutions. In conducting this review, the FFIEC or the agencies\nwill (a) categorize their regulations by type and (b) at regular intervals, provide notice and solicit\npublic comment on categories of regulations, requesting commenters to identify areas of\nregulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.4\nEGRPRA also requires the FFIEC or the agencies to publish in the Federal Register a\nsummary of the comments received, identifying significant issues raised and commenting on\n1 12 U.S.C. 3311.\n2 The FFIEC is an interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and\nreport forms for the Federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations\nto promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. The FFIEC does not issue\nregulations that impose burden on financial institutions and, therefore, we have not separately\ncaptioned the FFIEC in this document.\n3 The FFIEC is comprised of the OCC, Board, FDIC, National Credit Union Administration\n(NCUA), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and State Liaison Committee. Of\nthese, only the OCC, Board, and FDIC are statutorily required to undertake the EGRPRA review.\nThe NCUA elected to participate in the first and second EGRPRA reviews, and the NCUA\nBoard again has elected to participate in this review process.\nConsistent with its approach during the first and second EGRPRA reviews, NCUA will\nseparately issue documents and requests for comment on its rules. The CFPB is required to\nreview its significant rules and publish a report of its review no later than five years after they\ntake effect. See 12 U.S.C. 5512(d). This process is separate from the EGRPRA process.\n4 Insured depository institutions are also subject to regulations that are not reviewed under the\nEGRPRA process because they were not prescribed by the agencies. Examples include rules for\nwhich rulemaking authority was transferred to the CFPB and anti-money laundering regulations\n6 those issues. It also directs the agencies to eliminate unnecessary regulations, as appropriate.\nFinally, the statute requires the FFIEC to submit a report to Congress that summarizes any\nsignificant issues raised in the public comments and the relative merits of those issues. The\nreport must include an analysis of whether the agencies are able to address the regulatory\nburdens associated with such issues or whether those burdens must be addressed by legislative\naction.\nII. The EGRPRA Review\u2019s Targeted Focus\nThe EGRPRA regulatory review provides an opportunity for the public and the agencies\nto evaluate groups of related regulations and to identify opportunities for burden reduction.5 For\nexample, the EGRPRA review may facilitate the identification of statutes and regulations that\nshare similar goals or complementary methods where one or more agencies could eliminate the\noverlapping regulatory requirements. Alternatively, commenters may identify regulations or\nstatutes that impose requirements that are no longer consistent with current business practices\nand may warrant revision or elimination.\nThe EGRPRA review also provides the agencies and the public with an opportunity to\nconsider how to reduce the impact of regulations on community banks or their holding\ncompanies. The agencies are aware of the role that these institutions play in providing consumers\nand businesses across the nation with essential financial services and access to credit. The\nagencies are especially concerned about the impact of requirements for these smaller institutions.\nThe agencies understand that when a new regulation is issued or a current regulation is amended,\nsmaller institutions may have to devote a significant amount of their resources to determine if\nand how the regulation will affect them. Through the public comment process, the EGRPRA\nissued by the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, among\nothers. If, during the EGRPRA process, the agencies receive a comment about a regulation that is\nnot subject to the EGRPRA review, we will forward that comment to the appropriate agency.\n5 See supra note 1.\n7 review can help the agencies identify and target regulatory changes to reduce impacts for those\nsmaller institutions.\nBurden reduction must be compatible with consumer protection and the safety and\nsoundness of insured depository institutions, their affiliates, and the financial system as a whole.\nBurden reduction also must be consistent with the agencies\u2019 statutory mandates, many of which\nrequire the issuance of regulations. EGRPRA recognizes that effective burden reduction may\nrequire statutory changes. Accordingly, as part of this review, the agencies specifically ask the\npublic to comment on the relationship among burden reduction, regulatory requirements, policy\nobjectives, and statutory mandates. The agencies also seek quantitative data about the impact of\nrules, where available.\nThe agencies note that they must consider regulatory burden each time an agency\nproposes, adopts, or amends a rule. For example, under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 19956\nand the Regulatory Flexibility Act,7 the agencies assess each rulemaking with respect to the\nburdens the rule might impose. The agencies also invite the public to comment on proposed rules\nas required by the Administrative Procedure Act.8\nIII. The EGRPRA Review Process\nTaken together for purposes of the EGRPRA review process, the agencies\u2019 regulations\ncovering insured depository institutions encompass more than 100 subjects.9 Consistent with the\nEGRPRA statute and past practice, the agencies have grouped these regulations into the\nfollowing 12 categories listed in alphabetical order: Applications and Reporting; Banking\n6 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521.\n7 5 U.S.C. 610.\n8 5 U.S.C. 551-559.\n9 Consistent with EGRPRA\u2019s focus on reducing burden on insured depository institutions, the\nagencies have not included their internal, organizational, or operational regulations in this\nreview. These regulations impose minimal, if any, burden on insured depository institutions.\n8 Operations; Capital; Community Reinvestment Act; Consumer Protection;10 Directors, Officers\nand Employees; International Operations; Money Laundering; Powers and Activities; Rules of\nProcedure; Safety and Soundness; and Securities. These categories were used during the prior\nEGRPRA reviews. The agencies determined the categories by sorting the regulations by type and\nsought to have no category be too large or broad. These categories remain useful for the review,\nand the agencies have not modified the categories for purposes of this review.\nTo carry out the EGRPRA review, the agencies have now published four Federal\nRegister documents with each addressing three categories of rules. Each Federal Register\ndocument provided a 90-day comment period. On February 6, 2024, the agencies published the\nfirst document, addressing the following categories of regulations: Applications and Reporting;\nPowers and Activities; and International Operations.11 On August 1, 2024, the agencies\npublished a second document, addressing Consumer Protection, Directors, Officers and\nEmployees, and Money Laundering.12 On December 11, 2024, the agencies published a third\ndocument addressing Rules of Procedure; Safety and Soundness; and Securities.13 Today, the\nagencies are publishing the fourth document addressing the categories of Banking Operations,\nCapital, and the Community Reinvestment Act.14 The agencies invite the public to identify\noutdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulatory requirements for insured depository\n10 The agencies are seeking comment only on consumer protection regulations for which they\nretain rulemaking authority for insured depository institutions and holding companies under the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat.\n1376 (2010) (Dodd-Frank Act).\n11 89 FR 8084 (Feb. 6, 2024).\n12 89 FR 62679 (Aug. 1, 2024).\n13 89 FR 99751 (Dec. 11, 2024).\n14 With respect to the Community Reinvestment Act regulations, the agencies invite public\ncomment on the legacy CRA regulations. See discussion of the Interagency 2023 CRA rule,\ninfra.\n9 institutions and their holding companies in these three categories and any other rules finalized by\nthe agencies as of [INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].\nTo assist the public\u2019s understanding of how the agencies have organized the EGRPRA\nreview, the agencies have prepared a chart that lists the categories of regulations for which the\nagencies are requesting comments. The chart\u2019s left column divides the categories into specific\nsubject-matter areas. The headings at the top of the chart identify the types of institutions\naffected by the regulations.\nThe agencies will review the comments received and determine whether further action is\nappropriate with respect to the regulations. The agencies will consult and coordinate with each\nother and expect generally to make this determination jointly, as appropriate, in the case of rules\nthat have been issued on an interagency basis. Similarly, as appropriate, the agencies will\ncoordinate to amend or repeal those rules on an interagency basis. For rules issued by a single\nagency, the issuing agency will review the comments received and independently determine\nwhether amendments to or repeal of its rules are appropriate.\nFurther, as part of the EGRPRA review, the agencies are holding a series of public\noutreach meetings to provide an opportunity for bankers, consumer and community groups, and\nother interested parties to present their views directly to senior management and staff of the\nagencies. More information about the outreach meetings can be found on the agencies\u2019 EGRPRA\nWeb site, http:\/\/egrpra.ffiec.gov.\nIV. Request for Comments on Regulations in the Banking Operations, Capital, and\nCommunity Reinvestment Categories and on Any Rules Finalized by the Agencies As of\n[INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]\nThe agencies are requesting comment on regulations in the Banking Operations, Capital,\nand the Community Reinvestment Act categories to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly\nburdensome requirements for insured depository institutions and their holding companies. The\n10 agencies seek comment on all rules finalized by the agencies as of [INSERT DATE OF\nPUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]. In addition to comments on regulations in\nthese categories generally, the agencies are requesting comments on certain specific regulations\ndescribed below within these categories issued since the last EGRPRA review. Where possible,\nthe agencies ask commenters to cite to specific regulatory language or provisions. The agencies\nalso welcome suggested alternative provisions or language in support of a comment, where\nappropriate. The agencies will consider comments submitted anonymously.\nSpecific Issues for Commenters to Consider.\nThe agencies specifically invite comment on the following issues as they pertain to the\nagencies\u2019 Banking Operations, Capital, and the Community Reinvestment Act rules addressed in\nthis document. The agencies have asked these same questions for each document issued in\nconnection with the EGRPRA process and invite comments on these questions for the categories\nin the previous EGRPRA documents.\n\u2022 Need and purpose of the regulations.\no Question 1: Have there been changes in the financial services industry, consumer\nbehavior, or other circumstances that cause any regulations in these categories to\nbe outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome? If so, please identify the\nregulations, provide any available quantitative analyses or data, and indicate how\nthe regulations should be amended.\no Question 2: Do any of these regulations impose burdens not required by their\nunderlying statutes? If so, please identify the regulations and indicate how they\nshould be amended.\n11 \u2022 Overarching approaches\/flexibilities.\no Question 3: With respect to the regulations in these categories, could an agency\nuse a different regulatory approach to lessen the burden of the regulations and\nachieve statutory intent?\no Question 4: Do any of these rules impose unnecessarily inflexible requirements?\nIf so, please identify the regulations and indicate how they should be amended.\n\u2022 Cumulative effects.\no Question 5: Looking at the regulations in a category as a whole, are there any\nrequirements that are redundant, inconsistent, or overlapping in such a way that\ntaken together, impose an unnecessary burden that could potentially be\naddressed? If so, please identify those regulations, provide any available\nquantitative analyses or data, and indicate how the regulations should be\namended.\no Question 6: Have the agencies issued similar regulations in the same area that\nshould be considered together as bodies of regulation, when assessing the\ncumulative effects on an insured depository institution or holding company? If so,\nplease identify the regulations, why they should be considered together, and any\navailable analyses or data for the agencies\u2019 consideration.\no Question 7: Could any regulations or category of regulations be streamlined or\nsimplified to reduce unduly burdensome or duplicative regulatory requirements?\n\u2022 Effect on competition.\no Question 8: Do any of the regulations in these categories create competitive\ndisadvantages for one part of the financial services industry compared to another\nor for one type of insured depository institution compared to another? If so, please\nidentify the regulations and indicate how they should be amended.\n12 \u2022 Reporting, recordkeeping, and disclosure requirements.\no Question 9: Do any of the regulations in these categories impose outdated,\nunnecessary, or unduly burdensome reporting, recordkeeping, or disclosure\nrequirements on insured depository institutions or their holding companies?\no Question 10: Could an insured depository institution or its holding company\nfulfill any of these requirements through new technologies (if they are not already\npermitted to do so) and experience a burden reduction?

In July 2019, consistent with\nthe goals of the EGRPRA, the agencies finalized rules that simplified certain aspects of\nthe regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations with less than $250 billion\nin total consolidated assets or $10 billion in total consolidated foreign financial\n14 exposure.15 Specifically, this rule (1) simplified the regulatory capital treatment for\nmortgage servicing assets, temporary difference deferred tax assets, and holdings of\nregulatory capital instruments issued by other financial institutions and (2) simplified the\ncalculation for limitations on minority interest includable in regulatory capital. Initially,\nthe simplified requirements were to become effective on April 1, 2020. However, in\nNovember 2019, the agencies issued a subsequent notice to allow banking organizations\nto begin using the simplified requirements on January 1, 2020.16 Banking organizations\nthat chose not to adopt the simplifications on the earlier timetable were still permitted to\nwait until April 1, 2020, to implement the requirements.\n\u2022 Community Bank Leverage Ratio. In November 2019, the agencies implemented section\n201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act\n(EGRRCPA) 17 by revising their respective regulatory capital rules to provide a\nsimplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking\norganizations.18 Under this rule, banking organizations with less than $10 billion in total\nconsolidated assets that meet the qualifying criteria, including maintaining leverage ratio\ngreater than nine percent, may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework.\nThese banking organizations will be considered to have met the capital requirements for\nthe \u201cwell capitalized\u201d category under the agencies\u2019 prompt corrective action framework\nand will no longer be subject to the generally applicable risk-based capital rule.\n15 84 FR 35234 (July 22, 2019).\n16 84 FR 61804 (Nov. 13, 2019).\n17 See Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. 115\u2013174,\n132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n18 84 FR 61776 (Nov. 13, 2019), as corrected by 84 FR 70887 (Dec. 26, 2019), 85 FR 10968\n(Feb. 26, 2020).\n15 \u2022 Regulatory Capital Rule: Implementation and Transition of the Current Expected Credit\nLosses Methodology for Allowances and Related Adjustments to the Regulatory Capital\nRule and Conforming Amendments to Other Regulations. In February 2019, the agencies\nadopted a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles, including banking organizations\u2019 implementation of the\ncurrent expected credit losses methodology (CECL).19 The final rule provides banking\norganizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects\non regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In\naddition, the final rule revises the agencies\u2019 regulatory capital rule, stress testing rules,\nand regulatory disclosure requirements to reflect CECL, and makes conforming\namendments to other regulations that reference credit loss allowances.\n\u2022 Applicability Thresholds for Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements. In\nNovember 2019, the agencies published a final rule to revise the framework for\ndetermining the applicability of regulatory capital and standardized liquidity\nrequirements for large U.S. banking organizations, the U.S. intermediate holding\ncompanies (IHC) of certain foreign banking organizations, and certain of their depository\ninstitution subsidiaries.20\n\u2022 Capital Requirements for High Volatility Commercial Real Estate (HVCRE) Exposures.\nIn December 2019, the agencies implemented section 214 of the EGRRCPA by revising\nthe definition of HVCRE exposure, which had the effect of limiting the scope of the\nheightened risk weight applied to certain acquisition, development, and construction\nlending exposures.21\n19 84 FR 4222 (Feb. 14, 2019).\n20 84 FR 59230 (Nov. 1, 2019).\n21 84 FR 68019 (Dec. 13, 2019).\n16 \u2022 Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). In January 2020, the\nagencies published a final rule to provide an updated framework for measuring the\nexposure amount of derivatives contracts for the purpose of measuring their regulatory\ncapital requirements.22 The final rule replaced the current exposure methodology (CEM)\nwith the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk for the largest and most\ncomplex banking organizations, while permitting smaller banks to use either CEM or SA-\nCCR. SA-CCR is a more risk-sensitive approach that better reflects industry practices\nincluding margining for derivative contracts. Initially, the rule provided that banking\norganizations would have the option of using the SA-CCR beginning on April 1, 2020,\nand the largest, most complex banking organizations would be required to use it on\nJanuary 1, 2022. The agencies issued a subsequent notice in March 2020 providing that\nbanks would be permitted to begin using SA-CCR for their first quarter 2020 Call Report\nfilings.23 For the largest and most complex banking organizations, mandatory use of SA-\nCCR would continue to be delayed until January 1, 2022.\n\u2022 Exclusion from the Supplementary Leverage Ratio Calculation of Certain Central Bank\nDeposits for Banking Organizations Predominantly Engaged in Custody, Safekeeping,\nand Asset Servicing Activities. In January 2020, the agencies implemented section 402 of\nthe EGRRCPA by amending the supplementary leverage ratio, which is a measure of\ncapital adequacy that applies to large banking organizations.24 Section 402 provides that\nthe supplementary leverage ratio must not take into account funds of a custodial bank that\nare deposited with certain central banks, provided that any amount that exceeds the value\nof deposits of the custodial bank that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping\n22 85 FR 4362 (Jan. 24, 2020), as corrected by 85 FR 57956 (Sept. 2020).\n23 85 FR 17721 (Mar. 31, 2020).\n24 85 FR 4569 (Jan. 27, 2020).\n17 accounts must be taken into account. Therefore, this rule, which became effective on\nApril 1, 2020, provides that custodial banks are permitted to exclude from their total\nleverage exposure (the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio) the lesser of (1)\ndeposits at central banks and (2) client deposits linked to fiduciary or custodial and\nsafekeeping accounts. Federal Reserve Board regulations generally define \u201ccustodial\nbanking organization\u201d to include a top-tier depository institution holding company\ndomiciled in the United States that has assets under custody that are at least 30 times the\namount of the depository institution holding company\u2019s total assets.\n\u2022 Regulatory Capital Rule and Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Rule: Eligible Retained\nIncome. In October 2020, the agencies adopted revisions to a definition of eligible\nretained income made under the interim final rule published in the Federal Register on\nMarch 20, 2020, for all depository institutions, bank holding companies, and savings and\nloan holding companies subject to the agencies\u2019 capital rule.25 The final rule revises the\ndefinition of eligible retained income to make more gradual any automatic limitations on\ncapital distributions that could apply under the agencies\u2019 capital rule. Separately, in this\nfinal rule, the Board also adopted as final the definition of eligible retained income made\nunder the interim final rule published in the Federal Register on March 26, 2020, for\npurposes of the Board's total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule. The final rule adopts\nthese interim final rules with no changes.\n\u2022 Investments in Certain Unsecured Debt Instruments Issued by Global Systemically\nImportant U.S. Bank Holding Companies, Certain Intermediate Holding Companies, and\nGlobal Systemically Important Foreign Banking Organizations. In January 2021, the\nagencies published a final rule that applies to advanced approaches banking organizations\n25 85 FR 63423 (Oct. 8, 2020), as corrected 86 FR 3761 (Jan. 15, 2021).\n18 (generally, the largest, most interconnected banking organizations) with the aim of\nreducing both interconnectedness within the financial system and systemic risks.26 The\nfinal rule requires advanced approaches banking organizations to deduct from their\nregulatory capital calculations certain investments in unsecured debt instruments issued\nby foreign or U.S. global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs) for the\npurposes of meeting minimum total loss-absorbing capacity requirements and, where\napplicable, long-term debt requirements, or for investments in unsecured debt instruments\nissued by GSIBs that are pari passu or subordinated to such debt instruments. Under this\nrule, an advanced approaches banking organization may exclude from deduction\ninvestments in certain covered debt instruments up to five percent of its common equity\ntier 1 capital. Notably, use of this exclusion is tailored, depending on whether the\nadvanced approaches banking organization is a U.S. GSIB. For U.S. GSIBs, the\nexclusion is available only for investments in covered debt instruments that are held in\naccordance with market making activities, as identified using criteria from regulations\nimplementing section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act (commonly known as the\nVolcker Rule).\n\u2022 Interagency 2023 CRA Rule. In October 2023, the agencies jointly issued a final rule\n(Interagency 2023 CRA Rule) that amended their regulations implementing the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act of 1977 to update how CRA activities qualify for\nconsideration, where CRA activities are considered, and how CRA activities are\nevaluated. 27 The Interagency 2023 CRA Rule included an April 1, 2024, effective date\nand transition provisions for most substantive provisions; however, the rule has been\n26 86 FR 708 (Jan. 6, 2021).\n27 89 FR 6574 (Feb. 1, 2024).\n19 challenged in litigation and is currently enjoined.28 As such, the agencies continue to\nassess banks\u2019 CRA performance under the 1995 version of the CRA rules (legacy CRA\nregulations).29 On March 28, 2025, the agencies announced their intention to issue a\nproposal both to rescind the Interagency 2023 CRA Rule and reinstate the CRA\nframework that existed prior to the Interagency 2023 CRA Rule.30 Therefore, the\nagencies invite public comment on the legacy CRA regulations.\n\u2022 Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Supplemental Rule. In March 2024, the agencies\npublished an interim final rule and a final rule that revised the applicability date of certain\nprovisions of the Interagency 2023 CRA Rule31 and made certain other technical\namendments to the Interagency 2023 CRA Rule and related regulations.32\n\u2022 Revisions to Remove Obsolete References in the CRA Regulations. In December 2015,\nthe agencies made technical edits to the CRA regulations to remove obsolete references\n28 See Texas Bankers Association v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, No. 2:24-CV-\n025-Z-BR (N.D. Tex. 2024); see also Texas Bankers Association v. Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, No. 24-10367 (5th Cir. 2024).\n29 The text of the legacy CRA regulations may be found: (i) in the 2022, 2023, or 2024 bound\nversions of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations; (ii) in the historical version of the\nElectronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) as of March 29, 2024; or (iii) in appendix G of\nthe Interagency 2023 CRA Rule as published in the eCFR on February 1, 2024.\n30 See Joint Press Release, Agencies Announce Intent to Rescind 2023 Community Reinvestment\nAct Final Rule (March 28,\n2025), https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/pressreleases\/bcreg20250328a.htm; https:\/\/oc\nc.gov\/news-issuances\/news-releases\/2025\/nr-ia-2025-26.html; https:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/news\/press-\nreleases\/2025\/agencies-announce-intent-rescind-2023-community-reinvestment-act-final.\n31 See Interagency 2023 CRA Rule discussion, supra.\n32 89 FR 22060 (March 29, 2024). The supplemental rule included technical amendments to the\nagencies\u2019 CRA sunshine regulations, codified at 12 CFR parts 35 (OCC), 207 (Regulation G)\n(Board), and 346 (FDIC). In addition, the supplemental rule included technical amendments to\nthe OCC\u2019s public welfare investment regulation, codified at 12 CFR part 24, and the OCC\u2019s\nregulation concerning conversions from mutual to stock form, codified at 12 CFR part 192.\n20 to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and update cross-references to regulations\nimplementing certain Federal consumer financial laws.33\n\u2022 CRA Conforming Amendments Related to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)\nChanges. In November 2017, the agencies published a final rule that modified the\ndefinitions of \u201chome mortgage loan\u201d and \u201cconsumer loan,\u201d related cross references, and\nthe public file content requirements to conform to revisions made by the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau to Regulation C, which implements HMDA. The final rule\nalso removed obsolete references to the Neighborhood Stabilization Program.34\nSpecific OCC Regulations Issued Since the Last EGRPRA Review.\n\u2022 Assessment of Fees. In July 2014, the OCC published a final rule that raised marginal\nassessments on national banks and Federal savings associations with more than\n$40 billion in assets.35 This increase reflected new supervisory and regulatory initiatives\nthat required additional resources, especially for large bank supervision and regulation.\nMarginal assessment rates for national banks and Federal savings associations had not\nincreased between 1995 and 2013, and changes in 2008 lowered some large entities\u2019\nmarginal assessment rates. In August 2019, the OCC issued a separate assessments final\nrule in which it allowed banks that exit the jurisdiction of the OCC to receive a refund of\ncertain prospectively paid assessments.36\n\u2022 CRA Rescind and Replace Rule. In December 2021, the OCC adopted a final CRA rule\nbased largely on the agencies\u2019 1995 CRA rules.37 This action rescinded and replaced the\n33 80 FR 81162 (Dec. 29, 2015).\n34 82 FR 55734 (Nov. 24, 2017).\n35 79 FR 38769 (July 9, 2014).\n36 84 FR 43475 (Aug. 21, 2019).\n37 86 FR 71328 (Dec. 15, 2021).\n21 CRA final rule published by the OCC in June 2020, which updated and revised the\nOCC\u2019s CRA rule and integrated the CRA regulations in parts 25 (national banks) and 195\n(savings associations).38\nSpecific Board Regulations Issued Since the Last EGRPRA Review.\n\u2022 Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks. In June 2017 and September 2018, the\nBoard amended Regulation CC, Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks, which\nimplements the Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1987 (EFA Act), the Check Clearing\nfor the 21st Century Act of 2003 (Check 21 Act), and the official staff commentary to the\nregulation.39 Among other amendments, the Board modified the current check collection\nand return requirements to reflect the virtually all-electronic check collection and return\nenvironment and to encourage all depositary banks to receive, and paying banks to send,\nreturned checks electronically, and included provisions to address situations where there\nis a dispute as to whether a check has been altered or was issued with an unauthorized\nsignature, and the original paper check is not available for inspection. The Board and\nCFPB also amended Regulation CC in July 2019 and May 2024 to implement a statutory\nrequirement in the EFA Act to adjust the dollar amounts under the EFA Act for inflation,\nincorporate the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act\n(EGRRCPA) amendments, which include extending coverage to American Samoa, the\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, and implement technical\nedits. 40\n38 85 FR 34734 (June 5, 2020).\n39 82 FR 27552 (June 15, 2017); 83 FR 46849 (Sept. 17, 2018).\n40 84 FR 31687 (July 3, 2019), as corrected by 84 FR 45403 (Aug. 29, 2019); 89 FR 43737 (May\n20, 2024).\n22 \u2022 Collection of Checks and Other Items by Federal Reserve Banks and Funds Transfers\nThrough Fedwire. In November 2018 and June 2022, the Board published final\namendments to Regulation J, collection of checks and other items by Federal Reserve\nBanks and funds transfers through the Fedwire funds service and the FEDNOW service.41\nAmong other provisions, the amendments clarify and simplify certain provisions in\nRegulation J, remove obsolete provisions, and align the rights and obligations of sending\nbanks, paying banks, and Federal Reserve Banks with the Board\u2019s amendments to\nRegulation CC to reflect the virtually all-electronic check collection and return\nenvironment. Additionally, the Board published final provisions to govern funds transfers\nthrough the Federal Reserve Banks\u2019 FedNowSM Service and changes and clarifications to\nregulations governing the Fedwire Funds Service, to reflect the fact that the Reserve\nBanks will be operating a second funds transfer service in addition to the Fedwire Funds\nService, as well as technical corrections to regulations governing the check service.\n\u2022 Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing. In October 2022, the Board adopted a final\nrule that amends Regulation II to specify that the requirement that each debit card\ntransaction must be able to be processed on at least two unaffiliated payment card\nnetworks applies to card-not-present transactions, the requirement that debit card issuers\nensure that at least two unaffiliated networks have been enabled to process a debit card\ntransaction, and standardize and clarify the use of certain terminology.42\n\u2022 Regulation D: Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions. In July 2023, the Board\namended two sections of Regulation D to conform the provisions to prior regulatory\namendments.43\n41 83 FR 61509 (Nov. 30, 2018); 87 FR 34350 (June 6, 2022).\n42 87 FR 61217 (Oct. 11, 2022).\n43 88 FR 45057 (July 14, 2023).\n23 \u2022 Supervision and Regulation Assessments of Fees for Bank Holding Companies and\nSavings and Loan Holding Companies With Total Consolidated Assets of $100 Billion or\nMore. In December 2020, the Board adopted a final rule to amend the Board\u2019s\nassessment rule, Regulation TT, pursuant to Section 318 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), to address amendments\nmade by section 401 of the EGRRCPA.44 The final rule raises the minimum threshold for\nbeing considered an assessed company from $50 billion to $100 billion in total\nconsolidated assets for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies\nand adjusts the amount charged to assessed companies with total consolidated assets\nbetween $100 billion and $250 billion to reflect changes in supervisory and regulatory\nresponsibilities resulting from EGRRCPA.\n\u2022 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt, and Clean Holding Company\nRequirements for Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies and\nIntermediate Holding Companies of Systemically Important Foreign Banking\nOrganizations. In January 2017, the Board adopted a final rule to require a U.S. top-tier\nbank holding company identified under the Board\u2019s rules as a global systemically\nimportant bank holding company (covered BHC) to maintain outstanding a minimum\namount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured long-\nterm debt.45 In addition, the final rule prescribes certain additional buffers, the breach of\nwhich would result in limitations on the capital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments of a covered BHC. The final rule applies similar requirements to the top-tier\nU.S. intermediate holding company of a global systemically important foreign banking\norganization with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets (covered IHC). The final\n44 85 FR 78949 (Dec. 8, 2020).\n45 82 FR 8266 (Jan. 24, 2017).\n24 rule also imposes restrictions on other liabilities that a covered BHC or covered IHC may\nhave outstanding in order to improve their resolvability and resiliency; these restrictions\nare referred to in the final rule as \u201cclean holding company requirements.\u201d\n\u2022 Amendments to the Capital, Capital Plan, and Stress Test Rules. In February 2017 and\nMarch 2020, the Board adopted final rules amending the Board\u2019s regulatory capital rule,\ncapital plan rule, stress test rules, and Stress Testing Policy Statement.46 Among other\nchanges, the rules simplify the Board\u2019s capital framework while preserving capital\nrequirements for large firms and integrates the capital rule with the Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and Review (CCAR) through the establishment of the stress capital\nbuffer requirement. Through the integration of the capital rule and CCAR, the final rule\nremoved redundant elements of the current capital and stress testing frameworks that\ncurrently operate in parallel rather than together, including the CCAR quantitative\nobjection and the assumption that a banking organization makes all capital actions under\nstress.\n\u2022 Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements for Large Bank Holding Companies,\nIntermediate Holding Companies and Savings and Loan Holding Companies. In\nFebruary 2021, the Board adopted a final rule to tailor the requirements in the Board\u2019s\ncapital plan rule based on risk.47 Specifically, as indicated in the Board's October 2019\nrulemaking that updated the prudential framework for large bank holding companies and\nU.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations (tailoring\nframework), the final rule modifies the capital planning, regulatory reporting, and stress\ncapital buffer requirements for firms subject to \u201cCategory IV\u201d standards under that\nframework. To be consistent with recent changes to the Board's stress testing rules, the\n46 82 FR 9308 (Feb. 3, 2017); 85 FR 15576 (Mar. 18. 2020).\n47 86 FR 7927 (Feb. 3, 2021), as corrected by 86 FR 9261 (Feb. 12., 2021).\n25 final rule made other changes to the Board's stress testing rules, Stress Testing Policy\nStatement, and regulatory reporting requirements, such as the assumptions relating to\nbusiness plan changes and capital actions and the publication of company-run stress test\nresults for savings and loan holding companies. The final rule also applied the capital\nplanning and stress capital buffer requirements to covered saving and loan holding\ncompanies subject to Category II, Category III, and Category IV standards under the\ntailoring framework.\n\u2022 Regulatory Capital Rules: Risk-Based Capital Requirements for Depository Institution\nHolding Companies Significantly Engaged in Insurance Activities. In October 2023, the\nBoard finalized risk-based capital requirements for depository institution holding\ncompanies that are significantly engaged in insurance activities.48 This risk-based capital\nframework, termed the Building Block Approach, adjusts and aggregates existing legal\nentity capital requirements to determine enterprise-wide capital requirements. The final\nrule also contains a risk-based capital requirement excluding insurance activities, in\ncompliance with section 171 of The Dodd-Frank Act. The Board also adopted a reporting\nform FR Q-1 related to the Building Block Approach. The capital requirements and\nassociated reporting form meet statutory mandates and help to prevent the economic and\nconsumer impacts resulting from the failure of organizations engaged in banking and\ninsurance.\nSpecific FDIC Regulations Issued Since the Last EGRPRA Review.\n\u2022 Small Bank Assessments. In 2016, the FDIC refined the deposit insurance assessment\nsystem for small insured depository institutions that have been federally insured for at\nleast five years. The rule revised the financial ratios method so that it would be based on\n48 88 FR 82950 (Nov. 27, 2023).\n26 a statistical model estimating the probability of failure over three years, updated the\nfinancial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical\nmodel, and eliminated risk categories for established small banks and using the financial\nratios method to determine assessment rates for all such banks.49 In 2018, technical\namendments were made to the assessment rules to clarify that small bank assessment\ncredits would be applied when the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) is at\nleast 1.38 percent, removed a data item from the Call Report, and re-incorporated the\ncapital definitions and ratio thresholds used for prompt corrective action that were\ninadvertently removed in the 2016 rulemaking.50 In 2019, the FDIC amended the deposit\ninsurance assessment regulations that govern the use of small bank assessment credits\nand one-time assessment credits by certain insured depository institutions to require these\ncredits to continue as long as the DIF reserve ratio is at least 1.35 percent.51\n\u2022 Troubled Debt Restructuring Accounting Standards. The FDIC incorporated updated\naccounting standards in the risk-based deposit insurance assessment system applicable to\nall large IDIs. The rule modified borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the\nunderperforming assets ratio and higher-risk assets ratio for purposes of deposit insurance\nassessments.52\n\u2022 Initial Base Deposit Insurance Assessment. In 2019 and 2022, the FDIC adopted a final\nrule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points.\nThe increase in the assessment rate schedules increased the likelihood that the reserve\nratio will reach the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of\n49 81 FR 32180 (May 20, 2016), as amended at 85 FR 71227 (Nov. 9, 2020).\n50 83 FR 14565 (Apr. 5, 2018).\n51 84 FR 65269 (Nov. 27, 2019).\n52 87 FR 64348 (Oct. 24, 2022).\n27 September 30, 2028, consistent with the FDIC's Amended Restoration Plan, and is\nintended to support growth in the DIF in progressing towards the FDIC's long-term goal\nof a 2 percent Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR).53\n\u2022 Surcharges. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the FDIC's authority under section 7 of\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC imposed a surcharge on the quarterly\nassessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion\nor more.54\n\u2022 Assessments. Shortly after the banking agencies adopted the final rule that provided for a\nsimple measure of capital adequacy for certain community banking organizations, the\nFDIC amended its deposit insurance assessment to apply the CBLR framework to the\ndeposit insurance assessment system.55\n\u2022 Special Assessment Pursuant to Systemic Risk Determination. In response to the closures\nof Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the FDIC implemented a $16.3 billion\nspecial assessment at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points to recover the loss to the DIF.56\n\u2022 Reciprocal Deposits. The FDIC amended its regulations implementing brokered deposits\nand interest rate restrictions to conform with changes to section 29 of the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Act made by section 202 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and\nConsumer Protection Act related to reciprocal deposits.57\n\u2022 Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology. The FDIC addressed the temporary\ndeposit insurance assessment effects resulting from certain optional regulatory capital\n53 87 FR 64314 (Oct. 24, 2022).\n54 81 FR 16059 (Mar. 25, 2016), as amended at 83 FR 14568 (Apr. 5, 2018).\n55 84 FR 66833 (Dec. 6, 2019).\n56 88 FR 83329 (Nov. 29, 2023).\n57 84 FR 1346 (Feb. 4, 2019).\n28 transition provisions relating to the implementation of the current expected credit losses\nmethodology by adopting amendments to remove the double counting of a specified\nportion of the CECL transitional amount or the modified CECL transitional amount, as\napplicable, in certain financial measures that are calculated using the sum of Tier 1\ncapital and reserves and that are used to determine assessment rates for large or highly\ncomplex IDIs. The final rule also adjusted the calculation of the loss severity measure to\nremove the double counting of a specified portion of the CECL transitional amounts for a\nlarge or highly complex IDI.58\n\u2022 Company-Run Stress Testing Requirements for State Nonmember Banks and State\nSavings Associations. In 2019, the FDIC revised the minimum threshold from $10 billion\nto $250 billion for company-run stress tests applicable to state nonmember banks and\nstate savings associations. The FDIC also revised the frequency of required stress tests\nfrom annual to periodically and reduced the number of required stress testing scenarios\nfrom three to two.59\nV. Request for Additional Comments on All Regulations\nThe agencies also invite comment on the following questions regarding the agencies\u2019 rules in any\nof the 12 categories of regulations in this current notice and previous EGRPRA documents.\no Question 20: Are there additional comments you would like to provide about the\ncompliance costs for any of the EGRPRA categories included in prior EGRPRA\nnotices? If possible, please provide specific quantitative information about the\ncosts incurred. If possible, provide a specific breakdown of costs paid to various\nservices, e.g., labor, legal and other consulting services, technology.\n58 86 FR 11391 (Feb. 25, 2021).\n59 84 FR 56929 (Oct. 24, 2019), as corrected at 84 FR 64984 (Nov. 26, 2019).\n29 o Question 21: Are there analyses that quantify the monetary costs necessary to\ncomply with each of these rules? If possible, please provide a specific breakdown\nof costs paid to various services, e.g., labor, technology, legal or other consulting\nservices.\no Question 22: Looking at the regulations in a category as a whole, what changes\nwould effectively minimize monetary compliance costs while still maintaining the\nfirm\u2019s safety and soundness? If possible, provide specific quantitative information\nabout the current costs incurred and the associated cost reductions.\no Question 23: Are there additional costs incurred for maintaining reporting,\nrecordkeeping, and disclosure requirements for these rules that you wish to\nhighlight in addition to your response to question 13? If possible, provide a\nspecific breakdown of costs paid to various services, e.g., labor, legal and other\nconsulting services, technology, for reporting, recordkeeping, and disclosure.\no Question 24: Are there special considerations that might increase or decrease\ncompliance costs compared to typical compliance expenses for other firms for the\nrules in these categories? Responses are encouraged to be as specific and\nquantitative as possible about the differences in costs incurred and the special\ncharacteristics that drive those differences.\nVI. The Agencies\u2019 Review of Regulations under Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility\nAct (RFA)\nConsistent with past practice, the agencies will use the EGRPRA review to satisfy their\nrespective obligations under section 610 of the RFA.60 To that end, for each rule that has a\n60 Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 610, imposes a continuing obligation\non the agencies to review regulations that may have a significant economic impact upon a\nsubstantial number of small entities within 10 years after a final rulemaking is published. A\nsubset of the rules the agencies will review under EGRPRA will also be reviewed under the\nsection 610 review criteria. The agencies will indicate which rules are subject to section 610\n30 significant impact on a substantial number of small entities issued in the last 10 years, the\nagencies invite comment on (1) the continued need for the rule; (2) the complexity of the rule;\n(3) the extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates or conflicts with other Federal rules, and, to\nthe extent feasible, with State and local governmental rules; and (4) the length of time since the\nrule has been evaluated or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or other factors\nhave changed in the area affected by the rule. The purpose of the review will be to determine\nwhether such rules should be continued without change, or should be amended or rescinded,\nconsistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize any significant economic\nimpact of the rules upon a substantial number of such small entities.\nThe FDIC identified one rule pertaining to Capital that requires review under the RFA.\nThe agencies did not identify any additional rules in the categories of Banking Operations,\nCapital, and Community Reinvestment that require review under the RFA. Accordingly, the\nagencies will consider public comments submitted through the EGRPRA review process and\nagency experience to identify regulations where the agencies can reduce burdens that have a\nsignificant impact on a substantial number of small, insured depository institutions.61\nTitle: Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Capital\nAdequacy, Transition Provisions, Prompt Corrective Action, Standardized Approach for Risk\nreview. The factors the agencies consider in evaluating a rule under 5 U.S.C. 610 are (1) the\ncontinued need for the rule; (2) the nature of complaints or comments received concerning the\nrule from the public; (3) the complexity of the rule; (4) the extent to which the rule overlaps,\nduplicates or conflicts with other Federal rules, and, to the extent feasible, with State and local\ngovernmental rules; and (5) the length of time since the rule has been evaluated or the degree to\nwhich technology, economic conditions, or other factors have changed in the area affected by the\nrule.\n61 The review will be consistent with the requirements of a Regulatory Flexibility Act, section\n610 review. The agencies will determine whether particular rules should be continued without\nchange, amended, or rescinded, consistent with the objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize\nany significant economic impact of the rules on a substantial number of small, insured depository\ninstitutions.\n31 Weighted Assets, Market Discipline and Disclosure Requirements, Advanced Approaches Risk\nBased Capital Rule, and Market Risk Capital Rule\nCitation: 78 FR 55340 and 79 FR 20754\nAuthority: 12 U.S.C. 1831o(c) and See 12 U.S.C. 3907\nDescription: The FDIC adopted an interim final rule that revised its risk-based and leverage\ncapital requirements for FDIC-supervised institutions. The interim final rule is substantially\nidentical to a joint final rule issued by the OCC and the Board. The interim final rule implements\na revised definition of regulatory capital, a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital\nrequirement, a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement, and, for advanced approaches or\nCategory III FDIC-supervised institutions,62 a supplementary leverage ratio that incorporates a\nbroader set of exposures in the denominator. The interim final rule incorporates these new\nrequirements into the FDIC's prompt corrective action framework. In addition, the interim final\nrule establishes limits on FDIC-supervised institutions' capital distributions and certain\ndiscretionary bonus payments if the FDIC-supervised institution does not hold a specified\namount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum\nrisk-based capital requirements. The interim final rule amends the methodologies for determining\nrisk-weighted assets for all FDIC-supervised institutions. The interim final rule also adopts\nchanges to the FDIC's regulatory capital requirements that meet the requirements of section 171\nand section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The\ninterim final rule was subsequently adopted as final.63\n62 The applicability of the supplementary leverage ratio was expanded from advanced approaches\nbanking organizations to include Category III banking organizations in the agencies\u2019 tailoring\nfinal rule issued in 2019. See Changes to Applicability Thresholds for Regulatory Capital and\nLiquidity Requirements, 84 FR 59230 (Nov. 1, 2019).\n63 79 FR 20754 (Apr. 14, 2014).\n32 Prior RFA Analysis: A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared in accordance with 5\nU.S.C. 604 in conjunction with an interim final rule.64 In the interim final rule and subsequent\nfinal rule, the FDIC considered comments received on Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analyses\nincluded in three proposed rulemakings that preceded the interim and final rules.65\n64 78 FR 55340 (Aug. 10, 2013).\n65 77 FR 52792 (Aug. 30, 2012); 77 FR 52888 (Aug. 30, 2012); 77 FR 52978 (Aug. 30, 2012).\n33 State State BHCs & FHCs\nNational State Federal Savings\nSubject Non-Member Savings - - - - - - - -\nBanks Member Banks Associations\nBanks Associations SLHCs\nBanking Operations\nOCC Regulations\nAssessment of Fees 12 CFR Part 8 12 CFR Part 8\nNational Bank and Federal 12 CFR Part 7, 12 CFR Part 7,\nSavings Associations Subpart C Subpart C\nOperations\nSavings Association 12 CFR Part 163\nOperations\nDefinitions for Regulations 12 CFR Part 141\nAffecting Federal Savings\nAssociations\nDefinitions for Regulations 12 CFR Part 161\nAffecting All Savings\nAssociations\nBoard Regulations\nAssessment of Fees 12 CFR Part 246\n[Reg.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-72 | July 17, 2025 OCC Announces Enforcement Actions for July 2025 Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises. The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. The OCC does not have any enforcement actions against banks to release in July. The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs: Order of Prohibition against Lacey Ann Henry, former Teller Manager at a Trooper, Pennsylvania, branch of T.D. Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for making unauthorized cash withdrawals, totaling over $41,000, from customer checking accounts. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-27) Order of Prohibition against Alonso Missael Gonzalez Ibarra, former Teller and Lead Associate Operations at a Portland, Oregon, branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Columbus, Ohio, for stealing approximately $36,000 from ATMs and altering totals in the ATM records to make the ATMs appear to be in balance.

If adopted, the proposal would restore certainty in the CRA framework for stakeholders in light of pending litigation and limit regulatory burden on banks, while ensuring that banks continue to serve their communities. Because the 2023 final rule is subject to legal action and has not taken effect, the agencies continue to apply the 1995 regulations to banks today. Comments on the attached proposal are due 30 days after date of publication in the Federal Register.

Introduction\nThe agencies are proposing to rescind the CRA final rule issued on October 24, 2023, and\npublished in the Federal Register on February 1, 2024,1 as subsequently amended2 (2023 CRA\nFinal Rule). The agencies also are proposing to replace the 2023 CRA Final Rule with\nregulations adopted by the agencies and the former Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) on May\n4, 1995,3 as amended,4 and as published in the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR)\nas of March 29, 2024 (1995 CRA regulations), with conforming amendments to the agencies\u2019\ndefinition of \u201csmall bank\u201d and technical amendments to the OCC\u2019s definition of \u201csmall bank\u201d\nand transition provisions. The agencies are also proposing technical amendments to their\nregulations implementing the CRA sunshine requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\nand the OCC is proposing technical amendments to its Public Welfare Investments regulation. If\nadopted, the proposal would restore certainty in the CRA framework for stakeholders and limit\n1 89 FR 6574 (Feb. 1, 2024).\n2 89 FR 22060 (Mar. 29, 2024).\n3 60 FR 22156 (May 4, 1995). The OCC reissued its 1995 CRA regulation, as amended, with non-substantive\nchanges on December 15, 2021. See 86 FR 71328. For purposes of this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION,\nreference to the 1995 CRA regulations includes the OCC\u2019s 2021 CRA final rule.\n4 See e.g., 70 FR 44256 (Aug. 2, 2005); 75 FR 61035 (Oct. 4, 2010); 82 FR 55734 (Nov. 24, 2017).\n6 regulatory burden on banks,5 while ensuring that banks continue to focus on the purpose of the\nCRA.\nAs explained in greater detail below, banks currently operate under the framework of the\n1995 CRA regulations. Therefore, the agencies anticipate that transition considerations\nassociated with the proposed recodification of the 1995 CRA regulations would be de minimis.\nThe agencies believe the recodification of the 1995 CRA regulations would best achieve the\nagencies\u2019 objectives at this time, as discussed below.\nII. Background\nThe CRA\nCongress enacted the CRA6 in 1977 based on its findings that: \u201c(1) regulated financial\ninstitutions are required by law to demonstrate that their deposit facilities serve the convenience\nand needs of the communities in which they are chartered to do business; (2) the convenience\nand needs of communities include the need for credit services as well as deposit services; and (3)\nregulated financial institutions have continuing and affirmative obligation[s] to help meet the\ncredit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered.\u201d7 Accordingly, the purpose of\nthe CRA is to require the agencies to encourage regulated financial institutions8 \u201cto help meet\nthe credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered consistent with the safe and\nsound operation of the institutions.\u201d9\n5 For purposes of this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the term \u201cbank\u201d includes insured national\nbanks, Federal and State savings associations, and certain Federal branches of foreign banks as defined in proposed\n12 CFR 25.11; insured State nonmember banks and certain insured State branches of foreign banks as defined in 12\nCFR 345.11; and State member banks and certain uninsured State branches of foreign banks, as defined in 12 CFR\n228.11).\n6 Pub. L. 95\u2013128, 91 Stat. 1147 (1977) (codified at 12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq. (as amended)).\n7 12 U.S.C. 2901(a).\n8 The CRA defines \u201cregulated financial institution,\u201d to mean an insured depository institution as defined in 12\nU.S.C. 1813(c)(2). See 12 U.S.C. 2902(2).\n9 12 U.S.C. 2901(b).\n7 To achieve this purpose, the CRA requires the agencies to \u201cassess [an] institution\u2019s\nrecord of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution.\u201d10 Upon\ncompleting this assessment, the statute requires the agencies to \u201cprepare a written evaluation of\nthe institution\u2019s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods.\u201d11 The statute further provides that each agency must \u201ctake\nsuch record into account in its evaluation of an application for a deposit facility by such\ninstitution.\u201d12\nThe Agencies\u2019 Regulatory Framework\nThe CRA directs the agencies to publish regulations to carry out the purposes of the\nCRA.13 In general, the agencies\u2019 CRA regulations, first promulgated in 1978, establish the\nstandards under which the agencies evaluate banks\u2019 CRA performance.14 The agencies\u2019 1995\nCRA regulations significantly revised and clarified the 1978 regulations.15 Periodically, the\nagencies have jointly updated and revised the 1995 CRA regulations with minimal significant\nalterations to the overall regulatory framework.16 The OCC issued a separate CRA final rule in\nMay 2020, but rescinded it in December 2021.17\n10 12 U.S.C. 2903(a)(1).\n11 12 U.S.C. 2906(a).\n12 12 U.S.C. 2903(a)(2).\n13 12 U.S.C. 2905. Pursuant to Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\nPub. L. 111\u2013203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1522 (2010), the OTS\u2019s CRA rulemaking authority for all savings associations\ntransferred to the OCC and the OTS\u2019s CRA supervisory authority for State savings associations transferred to the\nFDIC. As a result, the OCC\u2019s CRA regulation applies to both State and Federal savings associations, in addition to\nnational banks, and the FDIC enforces the OCC\u2019s CRA regulation with respect to State savings associations.\n14 43 FR 47144 (Oct. 12, 1978).\n15 See supra note 3.\n16 For a complete discussion of the agencies\u2019 actions with respect to amending their CRA regulations, see the\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of the 2023 CRA Final Rule, 89 FR at 6580.\n17\nOn May 20, 2020, the OCC issued a final rule to revise and update its CRA regulation. 85 FR 34734 (June 5,\n2020). On December 15, 2021, the OCC published a subsequent final rule that rescinded its 2020 CRA regulation\nand replaced it with a CRA regulation based on those that the agencies jointly issued in 1995, as amended. See\nsupra note 3.\n8 The 2023 CRA Final Rule\nOn May 5, 2022, the agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize\ntheir regulations implementing the CRA.18 After considering public comments received, the\nagencies issued the 2023 CRA Final Rule on October 24, 2023.\nUnder the 2023 CRA Final Rule, as fully implemented:19\n\u2022 Large banks (institutions with assets of at least $2 billion as of December 31 in both\nof the prior two calendar years) would be subject to four performance tests: the Retail\nLending Test; the Retail Services and Products Test; the Community Development\nFinancing Test; and the Community Development Services Test.\n\u2022 Intermediate banks (institutions with assets of at least $600 million as of December\n31 in both of the prior two calendar years and less than $2 billion as of December 31\nin either of the prior two calendar years) would be subject to two performance tests:\nthe Retail Lending Test and the Intermediate Bank Community Development Test.\n\u2022 Small banks (institutions with assets less than $600 million as of December 31 in\neither of the prior two calendar years) would be subject to the Small Bank Lending\nTest.\n\u2022 Limited purpose banks (institutions that do not extend closed-end home mortgage\nloans, small business loans, small farm loans, or automobile loans to customers,\nexcept on an incidental and accommodation basis) would be subject to the\nCommunity Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks.\n18 87 FR 33884 (June 3, 2022).\n19 For a complete overview of the 2023 CRA Final Rule, see the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nsection of the rule, 89 FR at 6574-6579.\n9 \u2022 Generally, banks operating under an approved strategic plan would be subject to the\nsame performance tests they would have been subject to in the absence of a plan; the\nplan itself could include additions or modifications to tailor the applicable\nperformance tests to the bank\u2019s business model.\n\u2022 The agencies would continue to evaluate banks\u2019 performance in the areas surrounding\ntheir main office, branches, or deposit-taking remote service facilities (i.e., facility-\nbased assessment areas). In addition, the agencies would evaluate the retail lending\nperformance of certain large banks in areas outside their facility-based assessment\nareas where they have concentrations of retail loans (i.e., retail lending assessment\nareas) and the retail lending performance of large banks and certain intermediate and\nsmall banks in the nationwide area outside their facility-based assessment areas and\nretail lending assessment areas (i.e., outside retail lending areas). Further, the\nagencies would consider community development loans, community development\ninvestments, and community development services both inside and outside of a\nbank\u2019s facility-based assessment areas.\n\u2022 Large banks would be required to collect, maintain, and report certain data to enable\nevaluation under the applicable performance tests.\n\u2022 With respect to community development:\nThe rule specified in detail the categories of bank activities that would qualify for\no\nCRA consideration as a community development loan, community development\ninvestment, or community development service;\nThe agencies would provide an illustrative, non-exhaustive list of examples of\no\nloans, investments, and services that qualify for community development\n10 consideration and a process for banks to inquire whether a particular loan,\ninvestment, or service is eligible for consideration; and\nThe agencies would consider impact and responsiveness factors when evaluating\no\na bank\u2019s community development loans, community development investments,\nand community development services.\nAs adopted, the 2023 CRA Final Rule would have become effective on April 1, 2024;\nhowever, most substantive provisions of the rule would not have become applicable until January\n1, 2026, or January 1, 2027. During this transition period, the 2023 CRA Final Rule specified\nthat the 1995 CRA regulations, as reproduced in Appendix G of the 2023 CRA Final Rule,\nwould remain applicable.\nOn March 21, 2024, the agencies issued a supplemental rule to the 2023 CRA Final\nRule.20 The supplemental rule extended the applicability dates of the facility-based assessment\narea and public file provisions of the 2023 CRA Final Rule from April 1, 2024, to January 1,\n2026. The supplemental rule also included some technical, non-substantive amendments to the\n2023 CRA Final Rule and related regulations and corrected a citation to the OCC\u2019s CRA\nregulation.\nSeveral plaintiffs jointly filed suit against the agencies in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of Texas challenging aspects of the 2023 CRA Final Rule on February 5,\n2024,21 and subsequently requested a preliminary injunction on February 9, 2024.22 On March\n29, 2024, the district court granted plaintiffs\u2019 request and enjoined the agencies from enforcing\n20 See supra note 2.\n21 Complaint, Tex.

The district\ncourt\u2019s order also extended the 2023 CRA Final Rule\u2019s effective date of April 1, 2024, along\nwith all other implementation dates, day for day for each day the injunction remains in place.23\nOn April 18, 2024, the agencies appealed the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction to the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.24 However, on March 28, 2025, during the pendency\nof the appeal, the agencies made an unopposed motion to stay the appeal pending completion of\na new rulemaking that would propose rescinding the enjoined 2023 CRA Final Rule and\nreinstating the CRA framework that existed prior to the 2023 CRA Final Rule.25 The agencies\npublicly announced this intention the same day.26 On April 1, 2025, the Fifth Circuit granted the\nagencies\u2019 motion.27 In light of this preliminary injunction, the agencies are not supervising for,\nor applying, any provisions of the 2023 CRA Final Rule.\nIII. Proposed Rescission of 2023 CRA Final Rule\nThe agencies\u2019 reconsideration of the 2023 CRA Final Rule is precipitated primarily by\nthe uncertainty created by the pending litigation.28 Specifically, since the injunction was entered,\nthe agencies have observed confusion and inconsistent understandings among stakeholders\nregarding the status of the CRA regulatory and supervisory landscape.\n23 Tex.

Bankers Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., No. 24-10367 (5th Cir. Apr. 1, 2025),\nECF No. 174.\n28 The agencies also note that a change in agency priorities at the FDIC and OCC has taken place since the\nagencies adopted the 2023 CRA Final Rule.\n12 Accordingly, the agencies have reconsidered the status of the CRA regulatory framework\nwith two major objectives in mind: (1) restoring certainty in the CRA regulatory framework for\nstakeholders; and (2) limiting regulatory burden on banks. Further, the agencies took into\naccount that any changes to the proposed CRA regulatory framework must continue to focus on\nthe CRA\u2019s purpose\u2014encouraging banks to help meet the credit needs of the local communities\nin which they are chartered consistent with the safe and sound operation of the banks. The\nagencies\u2019 assessment of these objectives, as well as additional considerations that informed the\nagencies\u2019 reconsideration of the CRA regulatory framework, are discussed below.\nAgency Objectives\nRestoring Certainty. The agencies believe that returning to the regulatory framework\nestablished by the 1995 CRA regulations is the most effective way to provide certainty regarding\nthe applicable CRA requirements. Since the issuance of the preliminary injunction enjoining the\n2023 CRA Final Rule, the agencies\u2019 observations are that not all stakeholders understand\nwhether they should prepare to comply with the 2023 CRA Final Rule or even which regulatory\nframework is currently applicable. Proceeding with the litigation, particularly given its early\nstage, would maintain these uncertain circumstances for an indefinite period and would therefore\nbe inconsistent with the objective of restoring certainty in the CRA regulatory framework.\nThe agencies also understand that despite the fact that the 2023 CRA Final Rule is now\nenjoined and might not go into effect, banks might be devoting resources toward preparing for\nthe 2023 CRA Final Rule that could otherwise be allocated toward helping to meet the credit\nneeds of banks\u2019 communities. Returning to the 1995 CRA regulations at this time, in the\nagencies\u2019 view, would confirm for banks that they do not need to allocate resources for this\npurpose. Thus, this approach could better facilitate the purpose of the CRA\u2014encouraging banks\n13 to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered consistent with the\nsafe and sound operation of those banks.\nThe agencies\u2019 view that returning to the framework established by the 1995 CRA\nregulations would best restore certainty is also informed by the circumstances preceding the\nlitigation. The agencies have individually and collectively engaged in several iterations of\ninformation gatherings and CRA rulemaking processes since 2018 aimed at modernizing the\nCRA framework and increasing the clarity and consistency of CRA evaluations. These efforts\nhave resulted in a shifting CRA regulatory landscape, in particular, for national banks and\nsavings associations.29 This regulatory environment may have affected the planning,\ndevelopment, and management of banks\u2019 CRA programs, which can require multi-year strategies\nto align qualifying activities with CRA performance evaluation periods. Continuing the\nlitigation would prolong the period during which banks will need to consider impending changes\nin the regulatory framework while managing their CRA programs. Further, if the litigation\ncontinues, banks may need to anticipate and plan for potential contingencies in which all or a\npart of the 2023 CRA Final Rule could eventually become applicable. In light of this context,\nthe agencies believe that returning to the 1995 CRA regulations at this time would restore much\nneeded certainty for banks and other stakeholders.\nLimiting Regulatory Burden. When issuing the 2023 CRA Final Rule, the agencies\nsought to balance the increased regulatory burden imposed by the revised framework with\nbenefits associated with the agencies\u2019 policy objectives for updating the CRA framework. The\nagencies also recognized that a subset of banks would have additional regulatory requirements\nunder the 2023 CRA Final Rule relative to the 1995 CRA regulations. Furthermore, all banks\n29 See supra note 17.\n14 would have incurred near-term costs associated with reviewing the 2023 CRA Final Rule to\nensure that their policies; procedures; and data collection, maintenance, and reporting processes\nwould be compliant.\nIn contrast, because banks are currently subject to and examined under the 1995 CRA\nregulations, the agencies expect that any new regulatory burden associated with recodifying\nthose regulations will be de minimis. Further, the 1995 CRA regulations represent an established\nregulatory framework that is familiar to CRA stakeholders.30 Therefore, although the agencies\u2019\nreasons for modernizing the CRA framework remain valid, the agencies believe that replacing\nthe 2023 CRA Final Rule with the 1995 CRA regulations would better limit overall regulatory\nburden on banks at this time given the totality of the circumstances.\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the agencies believe that the need to restore certainty and\nlimit regulatory burden supports the decision to propose rescission of the 2023 CRA Final Rule\nand recodify the 1995 CRA regulations. Further, the agencies believe that recodifying the 1995\nCRA regulations will continue to support the purpose of the CRA.\nAdditional Agency Considerations\nThe following considerations also informed the agencies\u2019 review of the CRA regulatory\nframework and the proposal to return to the 1995 CRA regulations.\nChange in Policy. The agencies acknowledge that rescinding the 2023 CRA Final Rule\nwould represent a change in policy. However, the agencies note that many of the provisions in\nthe 2023 CRA Final Rule were included in, or substantially based on, the 1995 CRA regulations\n30 See, e.g., Laurie Goodman, et al., \u201cUnder the Current CRA Rules, Banks Earn Most of Their CRA Credit\nthrough Community Development and Single-Family Mortgage Lending,\u201d Urban Institute (July 9, 2020),\nhttps:\/\/www.urban.org\/urban-wire\/under-current-cra-rules-banks-earn-most-their-cra-credit-through-community-\ndevelopment-and-single-family-mortgage-lending; Daniel Ringo, Board, \u201c\u2018Revitalize or Stabilize\u2019: Does\nCommunity Development Financing Work?,\u201d Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-029 (Apr. 2020),\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/econres\/feds\/files\/2020029pap.pdf.\n15 or reflected existing agency supervisory policies. With respect to those provisions of the 2023\nCRA Final Rule, the proposal therefore does not reflect a significant change in policy. These\nprovisions include: many aspects of the regulatory definitions; facility-based assessment areas;\nthe Small Bank Performance Test; the Intermediate Bank Community Development Test; the\neffect of CRA performance on applications; the public file requirements; the public notice\nrequirements; and some data collection, maintenance, and reporting requirements. Moreover,\nrescinding the 2023 CRA Final Rule and recodifying the 1995 CRA regulations would not, in\npractice, result in a change for banks because the agencies are currently applying the 1995 CRA\nregulations to banks.\nFurther, the agencies believe that any reliance interests vested in the 2023 CRA Final\nRule are as yet de minimis because the rule was enjoined prior to its effective and applicability\ndates. Put simply, the 2023 CRA Final Rule has never applied to any bank.\nTransition Issues. The agencies believe that transition considerations associated with\nimplementing the proposal would likewise be de minimis. The agencies currently evaluate bank\nCRA performance under the 1995 CRA regulations because the 2023 CRA Final Rule never took\neffect. Therefore, the agencies expect that a recodification of the 1995 CRA regulations will\nhave a negligible transitional impact on all CRA stakeholders.\nAlternatives Considered\nAlthough there are potential alternatives to rescinding the 2023 CRA Final Rule and\nreturning to the 1995 CRA regulations, the agencies believe that these alternatives do not best\nmeet the agencies\u2019 objectives in reconsidering the CRA framework at this time.\nOne alternative the agencies considered was maintaining the 2023 CRA Final Rule.\nHowever, the agencies believe that this alternative would be unviable. As discussed above,\n16 maintaining the 2023 CRA Final Rule would potentially require continuing with protracted\nlitigation, thereby extending the current uncertainty related to the applicable CRA regulatory\nframework. Ultimately, that litigation could result in changes to or a voiding of the 2023 CRA\nFinal Rule, imposing further uncertainty over an extended period. As also discussed above, the\nagencies believe that maintaining the 2023 CRA Final Rule could result in banks expending\nresources to implement the rule without knowing whether all or part of the rule would survive\nthe legal challenge.\nAnother alternative the agencies considered was proposing to replace the 2023 CRA\nFinal Rule with a new CRA framework that is materially different from the framework contained\nin the 2023 CRA Final Rule. However, proposing to establish a materially revised framework\nwould involve undertaking an extensive regulatory process, which would not be consistent with\nthe agencies\u2019 objective of restoring certainty in the near term. The agencies believe that\nrecodifying the 1995 CRA regulations at this time would provide a more predictable\nenvironment and best position stakeholders to manage any possible future regulatory\ndevelopments.\nLastly, the agencies reviewed the option of proposing targeted amendments to the 2023\nCRA Final Rule. However, the agencies considered that, because the 2023 CRA Final Rule is\nstructured in a comprehensive, layered format with interdependent provisions, removing only\ncertain provisions would be incompatible with the operational structure of the rule. For example,\nproposing to remove the retail lending assessment area provision would also require the agencies\nto propose related changes to provisions concerning: the Retail Lending Test overall; outside\nretail lending areas; affiliate lending; strategic plans; public file requirements; appendix A of the\n2023 CRA Final Rule (Calculations for the Retail Lending Test); the manner in which\n17 conclusions and ratings are calculated for all applicable performance tests under appendices C\nand D; and data collection, maintenance, and reporting requirements.\nFurthermore, by proposing to amend the 2023 CRA Final Rule instead of rescinding it\nand replacing it with the 1995 CRA regulations, an established CRA framework, the agencies\nwould be embarking upon a potentially lengthy period of rulemaking-related activities, thereby\ncontinuing the uncertainty for CRA stakeholders. Therefore, the agencies do not believe that it is\nfeasible to amend the 2023 CRA Final Rule in a way that meets the agencies\u2019 objectives of\nrestoring certainty.\nAccordingly, the agencies believe that rescinding the entire 2023 CRA Final Rule and\nrecodifying the 1995 CRA regulations is the best approach at this time to accomplish the\nagencies\u2019 objectives of restoring certainty and limiting regulatory burden while meeting the\npurpose of the CRA\u2014encouraging banks to help meet the credit needs of the local communities\nin which they are chartered consistent with the safe and sound operation of those banks.\nIV. Description of the Proposed Rule\nThe proposal would recodify the 1995 CRA regulations currently applicable to banks, as\npublished in the eCFR as of March 29, 2024, with updated asset-size thresholds for the definition\nof \u201csmall bank\u201d to reflect the agencies\u2019 inflation adjustments for 2025.31 (As described\nelsewhere in this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the OCC\u2019s proposed regulatory text\nalso includes technical amendments to its definition of \u201csmall bank\u201d and its transition\nprovisions.) As such, the proposal includes the provisions described below.\nStandards for Assessing Performance\n31 The agencies annually adjust the CRA asset-size thresholds based on the annual percentage change in a\nmeasure of the Consumer Price Index. The bank asset-size thresholds set forth in this proposed rule are accurate\nthrough December 31, 2025. See 89 FR 106480 (Dec. 30, 2024) (Board and FDIC); OCC Bulletin 2024-36 (Dec. 23,\n2024), https:\/\/www.occ.treas.gov\/news-issuances\/bulletins\/2024\/bulletin-2024-36.html (OCC).\n18 The proposal provides the following different methods to evaluate a bank\u2019s CRA\nperformance depending on bank asset size and business strategy:\n\u2022 Small banks that are not intermediate small banks\u2014defined as banks with assets of\nless than $402 million as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years\u2014\nwould be evaluated under a lending test and may receive an \u201cOutstanding\u201d rating\nbased only on their retail lending performance. Qualified investments, services, and\ndelivery systems that enhance credit availability in a bank\u2019s assessment areas may\nbe considered for an \u201cOutstanding\u201d rating, but only if the bank meets or exceeds the\nlending test criteria in the small bank performance standards.\n\u2022 Intermediate small banks\u2014defined as small banks with assets of at least $402\nmillion as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than\n$1.609 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years\u2014would\nbe evaluated under the lending test for small banks and a community development\ntest. The intermediate small bank community development test would evaluate all\ncommunity development activities combined.\n\u2022 Large banks\u2014those banks with assets of at least $1.609 billion as of December 31\nof both of the prior two calendar years\u2014would be evaluated under separate lending,\ninvestment, and service tests. The lending and service tests would consider both\nretail and community development activities, and the investment test would focus\non qualified investments. To facilitate the agencies\u2019 CRA analysis, large banks\nwould be required to report annually certain data on community development loans,\nsmall business loans, and small farm loans. Small banks and intermediate small\n19 banks would not be required to report these data unless they opt into being\nevaluated under the large bank lending tests.\n\u2022 Designated wholesale banks (those engaged in only incidental retail lending) and\nlimited purposes banks (those offering a narrow product line to a regional or\nbroader market) would be evaluated under a standalone community development\ntest.\n\u2022 Banks of any size could elect to be evaluated under a strategic plan that sets out\nmeasurable, annual goals for lending, investment, and service activities to achieve a\n\u201cSatisfactory\u201d or an \u201cOutstanding\u201d rating. A strategic plan would need to be\ndeveloped with community input and approved by the appropriate Federal financial\nsupervisory agency.\nThe proposal provides that the agencies could also consider applicable performance\ncontext information to develop their analyses and conclusions when conducting CRA\nexaminations.32 Performance context would comprise a broad range of economic, demographic,\nand bank- and community-specific information that examiners review to calibrate a bank\u2019s CRA\nevaluation to its communities. Consistent with the statute, the proposed regulations would not\nrequire banks to make loans or investments or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe\nand sound operations.33\nAssigned Ratings\nIn general, the agencies would assign banks\u2019 CRA ratings under the applicable\nperformance tests and standards (e.g., for large banks, the lending, investment, and service\n32 See proposed 12 CFR __.21(b).\n33 See proposed 12 CFR __.21(d).\n20 tests).34 The evaluation of a bank\u2019s CRA performance would be adversely affected by evidence\nof discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.35\nAssessment Areas\nThe proposal would require a bank to delineate one or more assessment areas in which\nthe bank\u2019s record of meeting its CRA obligations is evaluated. Specifically, the proposed\nregulatory text would require a bank to delineate assessment areas generally consisting of (1) one\nor more metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) or metropolitan divisions or (2) one or more\ncontiguous political subdivisions36 in which the bank has its main office, branches, and, as\napplicable, deposit-taking automated teller machines (ATMs)37 or remote service facilities\n(RSFs),38 as well as the surrounding geographies39 (i.e., census tracts) in which the bank has\noriginated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage loans, small\nbusiness loans, small farm loans, and any other loans the bank chooses, such as consumer loans,\non which the bank elects to have its performance assessed).40\nQualifying Activities\nThe proposal, along with the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community\nReinvestment, provide detailed information, including applicable definitions and descriptions,\nregarding activities that are eligible for CRA consideration in the evaluation of a bank\u2019s CRA\nperformance. Banks that are evaluated under a performance test that includes a review of their\nretail activities would be assessed in connection with retail lending activity (e.g., home mortgage\n34 See proposed 12 CFR __.28(a) and (b).\n35 See proposed 12 CFR __.28(c).\n36 Political subdivisions include cities, counties, towns, townships, and Indian reservations. See \u00a7 __.41(c)(1)\n\u20141, Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment, 81 FR 48506 (July 25, 2016).\n37 See proposed 12 CFR 25.41(c)(2) (OCC); proposed 12 CFR 228.41(c)(2) (Board).\n38 See proposed 12 CFR 345.41(c)(2) (FDIC).\n39 See proposed 12 CFR __.41.\n40 See proposed 12 CFR __.41.\n21 loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and consumer loans)41 and, where applicable, retail\nbanking service activities (e.g., the current distribution of a bank\u2019s branches in geographies of\ndifferent income levels, and the availability and effectiveness of the bank\u2019s alternative systems\nfor delivering banking services to low- and moderate-income geographies and individuals).42\nBanks evaluated under a performance test that includes a review of their community\ndevelopment activities would be assessed with respect to community development lending,\nqualified investments, and community development services, which must have a primary\npurpose of community development.43\nOther Provisions\nThe proposal also includes the following provisions:\n\u2022 The agencies would be required to consider the effect of a bank\u2019s CRA performance\non certain banking applications.44 In connection with a banking application,\ninterested parties could submit comments regarding the bank\u2019s CRA performance.\nFurthermore, a bank\u2019s CRA performance could be the basis for denying or\nconditioning approval of such applications.\n\u2022 A bank would be required to collect, maintain, and report certain data to enable\nagencies to evaluate its CRA performance.45 Small banks and intermediate small\nbanks would generally be exempt from these requirements.\n41 See proposed 12 CFR __.12(j), (l), (v), and (w).\n42 See generally proposed 12 CFR __.21 through __.27; see also proposed 12 CFR __.24(d).\n43 See proposed 12 CFR __.12(g), (h), (i), and (t); see also proposed 12 CFR __.21 through __.27.\n44 See proposed 12 CFR __.29. The covered applications are aligned with the definition of \u201capplication for a\ndeposit facility\u201d found in 12 U.S.C. 2902(3).\n45 See proposed 12 CFR __.42.\n22 \u2022 A bank would be required to maintain certain information related to CRA\nperformance in its public file.46 The proposed public file provision specifies what\ninformation must be included, where information in the public file must be made\navailable for public inspection, and the provision of copies.\n\u2022 A bank would be required to maintain the proposed public notice contained in\nappendix B in the public lobby of its main office and in each of its branches.47\n\u2022 As required by the CRA,48 a bank could receive positive CRA consideration for\nlow-cost education loans provided to low-income borrowers and activities in\ncooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-income\ncredit unions.49\n\u2022 The agencies would be required to publish a schedule of planned CRA\nexaminations.50\nOCC Provisions\nAs in the OCC\u2019s 1995 CRA regulation, the proposal includes provisions that apply only\nto the OCC. Specifically, the proposed OCC regulation includes two transition provisions that\nhave been applicable since January 1, 2022, the effective date of the OCC\u2019s 2021 CRA final rule,\nwith technical corrections. First, in assessing a bank\u2019s performance, the OCC would consider\nany investment, loan, or service that is eligible for CRA consideration at the time the bank\nconducted the activity.51 Second, a strategic plan in effect as of December 31, 2021, would\nremain in effect, except that provisions of the plan that are not consistent with the OCC\u2019s CRA\n46 See proposed 12 CFR __.43.\n47 See proposed 12 CFR __.44.\n48 12 U.S.C. 2903(b) and (d).\n49 See proposed 12 CFR __.21(e) and (f).\n50 See proposed 12 CFR __.45.\n51 See proposed 12 CFR __.51.\n23 regulation in effect as of January 1, 2022, are void, unless amended. These transition provisions\nare necessary because the OCC had adopted and then rescinded the final rule it issued in 2020.\nIn both these provisions, the OCC proposes a technical amendment to apply them to savings\nassociations as well as national banks. This change would correct a drafting error in the OCC\u2019s\n2021 CRA final rule.52\nIn addition, the proposal includes subpart E, Prohibition Against Use of Interstate\nBranches Primarily for Deposit Production. This subpart implements section 109 of the Riegle-\nNeal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, 12 U.S.C. 1835a, which only\napplies to certain national banks and Federal branches of a foreign bank. Subpart E redesignates\nbut does not amend subpart F of the 2023 CRA Final Rule. The Board and the FDIC include\nthese provisions in separate regulations.53\nV. Other Proposed Amendments\nCRA Sunshine Regulations\nThe agencies are proposing conforming changes to their regulations implementing the\nCRA sunshine requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act54 (CRA Sunshine\nRegulations).55 The CRA Sunshine Regulations currently cross-reference to the agencies\u2019 CRA\nregulations in appendix G of the 2023 CRA Final Rule. The proposed amendments would\nremove all references to appendix G so that the CRA Sunshine Regulations would instead cross-\nreference to the proposed recodification of each agency\u2019s respective 1995 CRA regulation.\nOCC Amendments\n52 See supra note 3.\n53 See 12 CFR 208.7 (Board); 12 CFR part 369 (FDIC).\n54 Codified at 12 U.S.C. 1831y.\n55 12 CFR parts 35 (OCC); 12 CFR 207 (Regulation G) (Board); and 12 CFR 346 (FDIC).\n24 The OCC is proposing several clarifying amendments and a technical correction to the\ndefinition of \u201csmall bank\u201d in 12 CFR 25.12(u). First, the OCC proposes to clarify that the dollar\namounts included in the definition would only apply for calendar year 2025. Second, the OCC\nproposes to indicate that the annual adjustments to the thresholds included in the definition are\npublished on the OCC\u2019s website. Since 2020, the OCC has announced the new asset-size\nthresholds for this definition each year by publication of an OCC Bulletin on OCC.gov and does\nnot amend \u00a7 25.12(u) with the new thresholds. Together, these proposed amendments would\nensure that stakeholders are informed that the asset-size thresholds in the definition are not\ncurrent for years other than 2025 and direct stakeholders to where they can obtain the current\nthresholds. The OCC intends for these amendments to provide additional clarity and\ntransparency. Third, the OCC is proposing to remove \u201cappropriate Federal banking agency\u201d in\nthe definition so that the provision provides that only the OCC updates this asset-size threshold\nannually. Part 25 defines \u201cappropriate Federal banking agency\u201d to be the OCC and the FDIC.\nHowever, only the OCC updates the asset-size thresholds in the \u201csmall bank\u201d definition of part\n25.\nIn addition, the OCC is proposing conforming amendments to its Public Welfare\nInvestment regulation, 12 CFR part 24. Part 24 currently refers to the OCC\u2019s CRA regulation,\n12 CFR part 25, as appendix G of the 2023 CRA Final Rule. The proposed amendment would\nremove all references to appendix G so that part 24 would instead cross-reference to the\nproposed recodification of the OCC\u2019s 1995 CRA regulation.56\n56 The Board's public welfare investment regulation does not cite to its CRA regulation and thus does not need\nto be amended. See 12 CFR 208.22. The FDIC does not have public welfare investment regulations.\n25 VI. Request for Comments\nThe agencies request feedback on all aspects of the proposed rule.57\nVII. Regulatory Analysis\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\nOCC. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (RFA), requires an agency to\nconsider the impact of its proposed rules on small entities. In connection with a proposed rule,\nthe RFA generally requires an agency to prepare an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\n(IRFA) describing the impact of the rule on small entities, unless the head of the agency certifies\nthat the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of\nsmall entities and publishes such certification along with a statement providing the factual basis\nfor such certification in the Federal Register. An IRFA must contain: (1) a description of the\nreasons why action by the agency is being considered; (2) a succinct statement of the objectives\nof, and legal basis for, the proposed rule; (3) a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of\nthe number of small entities to which the proposed rule will apply; (4) a description of the\nprojected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule,\nincluding an estimate of the classes of small entities that will be subject to the requirements and\nthe type of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record; (5) an\nidentification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules that may duplicate, overlap\nwith, or conflict with the proposed rule; and (6) a description of any significant alternatives to\nthe proposed rule that accomplish its stated objectives.\n57 The agencies note that they are currently engaged in the review of all their regulations under the Economic\nGrowth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA), 12 U.S.C. 3311, which, in general, requires the\nagencies to conduct a review of their regulations not less frequently than once every 10 years to identify outdated or\notherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements imposed on banks. As part of this review, the agencies are\nrequesting comment on their CRA regulations. See: https:\/\/egrpra.ffiec.gov\/federal-register-notices\/fedreg-\nindex.html. The agencies generally expect to consider any EGRPRA comments received on their CRA regulations\nseparately from this rulemaking.\n26 The OCC currently supervises 1,030 institutions (commercial banks, trust companies,\nFederal savings associations, and branches or agencies of foreign banks),58 of which\napproximately 609 are small entities under the RFA.59\nBecause of the preliminary injunction enjoining the 2023 CRA Final Rule, the OCC used\nthe 1995 CRA regulations as the baseline in its RFA analysis. Using this baseline, the OCC\nestimates the cost of the proposal to be de minimis because the proposed rule would return to the\n1995 regulation, which is currently applicable to banks. Therefore, the OCC certifies that this\nproposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of\nsmall entities. Accordingly, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.\nBoard. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (RFA), requires an agency to\nconsider whether the rules it proposes will have a significant economic impact on a substantial\nnumber of small entities. In connection with a proposed rule, the RFA generally requires an\nagency to prepare an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) describing the impact of the\nrule on small entities, unless the head of the agency certifies that the proposal will not have a\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and publishes such\ncertification along with a statement providing the factual basis for such certification in the\nFederal Register. An IRFA must contain (i) a description of the reasons why action by the\nagency is being considered; (ii) a succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for, the\nproposal; (iii) a description of, and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities to\n58 Based on data accessed using the OCC\u2019s Financial Institutions Data Retrieval System on May 8, 2025.\n59 The OCC bases its estimate of the number of small entities on the Small Business Administration\u2019s size\nthresholds for commercial banks and savings institutions, and trust companies, which are $850 million and $47\nmillion, respectively. Consistent with the General Principles of Affiliation, 13 CFR 121.103(a), the OCC counted\nthe assets of affiliated financial institutions when determining if it should classify an OCC-supervised institution as a\nsmall entity. The OCC used average quarterly assets in 2024 to determine size because a \u201cfinancial institution\u2019s\nassets are determined by averaging the assets reported on its four quarterly financial statements for the preceding\nyear.\u201d See footnote 8 of the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Table of Size Standards.\n27 which the proposal will apply; (iv) a description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and\nother compliance requirements of the proposal, including an estimate of the classes of small\nentities that will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for\npreparation of the report or record; (v) an identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant\nFederal rules that may duplicate, overlap with, or conflict with the proposal; and (vi) a\ndescription of any significant alternatives to the proposal that accomplish its stated objectives\nand minimize any significant economic impact of the proposal on small entities.\nThe Board is providing an IRFA with respect to the proposal. The Board invites\ncomment on all aspects of this IRFA.\n1. Reasons Action is Being Considered\nThe Board proposes to rescind the 2023 CRA Final Rule and replace it with the 1995\nCRA regulations, with conforming amendments to the definition of \u201csmall bank.\u201d Together with\nthe other agencies, the Board believes that the proposal would restore certainty in the CRA\nframework for stakeholders and limit regulatory burden on banks, while ensuring that banks\ncontinue to focus on the purpose of the CRA. As described above, banks currently operate under\nthe framework of the 1995 regulations.\n2. Objectives of and Legal Basis for the Proposal\nSection 806 of the CRA (12 U.S.C. 2905) requires the Board to publish regulations to\ncarry out the purposes of the CRA.\nThe Board\u2019s and the other agencies\u2019 reconsideration of the 2023 CRA Final Rule is\nprecipitated primarily by the uncertainty created by the pending litigation. Accordingly, the\nagencies have reconsidered the status of the CRA regulatory framework with two major\nobjectives in mind: (1) restoring certainty in the CRA regulatory framework for stakeholders;\n28 and (2) limiting regulatory burden on banks. Further, the agencies took into account that any\nchanges to the proposed CRA regulatory framework must continue to focus on the CRA\u2019s\npurpose\u2014encouraging banks to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which\nthey are chartered consistent with the safe and sound operation of the banks. The agencies\u2019\nassessment of these objectives, as well as additional considerations that informed the agencies\u2019\nreconsideration of the CRA regulatory framework, are discussed in section III of this\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.\n3. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities\nBoard-supervised institutions that would be subject to the proposed rule are State member\nbanks (as defined in section 3(d)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) and uninsured State\nbranches of foreign banks (other than limited branches) resulting from certain acquisitions under\nthe International Banking Act. Banks that do not perform commercial or retail banking services\nby granting credit to the public in the ordinary course of business would not be subject to the\nproposal.\nThe Board generally uses the industry-specific size standards adopted by the SBA for\npurposes of estimating the number of small entities to which a proposal would apply.60 The SBA\nhas adopted size standards that provide that depository institutions with average assets of less\nthan $850 million over the preceding year (based on the institution\u2019s four quarterly financial\nstatements) are considered small entities.61 The Board estimates that approximately 446 Board-\nsupervised small entities would be subject to the proposed rule.62\n60 See 13 CFR 121.201. Consistent with the SBA\u2019s General Principles of Affiliation, the Board generally\nincludes the assets of all domestic and foreign affiliates toward the applicable size threshold when determining\nwhether to classify a particular entity as a small entity. See 13 CFR 121.103.\n61 See 13 CFR 121.201 (sectors 522110\u2013522180).\n62 The Board's estimate is based on total assets reported on Forms FR Y-9 (Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor Holding Companies) and FFIEC 041 (Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income) for 2024.\n29 4. Description of Compliance Requirements\nThe proposal would recodify the 1995 CRA regulations currently applicable to banks,\nwith updated asset-size thresholds for the definition of \u201csmall bank\u201d to reflect the agencies\u2019\ninflation adjustments for 2025. In general, the CRA framework establishes the performance tests\nand standards that the Board uses to assess a bank\u2019s CRA performance and adopts related\nrequirements (including reporting, recordkeeping, disclosure, and other compliance\nrequirements) to facilitate CRA evaluations. A fuller description of the proposal, including\nreporting, recordkeeping, disclosure, and other compliance requirements, is provided in sections\nIV and VII (Paperwork Reduction Act) of this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.\n5. Duplicative, Overlapping, and Conflicting Rules\nThe Board is not aware of any federal rules that may duplicate, overlap with, or conflict\nwith the proposal.\n6. Significant Alternatives Considered\nAs an alternative to the proposal, the Board (together with the other agencies) considered\nmaintaining the 2023 CRA Final Rule, proposing to replace the 2023 CRA Final Rule with a\nnew CRA framework that is materially different from the framework contained in the 2023 CRA\nrule, and proposing targeted amendments to the 2023 CRA Final Rule. The agencies\u2019 analysis of\neach of these alternatives is discussed in section III of this SUPPLEMENTARY\nINFORMATION.\nFDIC. The RFA generally requires an agency, in connection with a proposed rule, to\nprepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis that\ndescribes the impact of the proposed rule on small entities.63 However, an IRFA is not required\n63 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.\n30 if the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Small Business Administration\n(SBA) has defined \u201csmall entities\u201d to include banking organizations with total assets of less than\nor equal to $850 million.64 Generally, the FDIC considers a significant economic impact to be a\nquantified effect in excess of 5 percent of total annual salaries and benefits or 2.5 percent of total\nnoninterest expenses. The FDIC believes that effects in excess of one or more of these\nthresholds typically represent significant economic impacts for FDIC-supervised institutions.\nThe FDIC believes that the proposed rule is unlikely to have a significant impact on a substantial\nnumber of small entities. The FDIC\u2019s rationale for its determination is discussed below.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there are 2,854 FDIC-supervised IDIs, of which 2,122 are\n\u201csmall entities\u201d under the RFA.65 Of these, 2,116 are subject to the CRA and covered by the\nproposal. As discussed in the Supplementary Information, the proposal would return the CRA\nexamination framework to the framework in place prior to the adoption of the 2023 CRA Final\nRule. The 2023 CRA Final Rule was enjoined by court order on March 29, 2024, therefore it\nnever went into effect and small entities have instead been subject to the CRA framework in the\nproposed rule. Thus, if the proposal is adopted, small entities would experience no change in\ntheir CRA examination framework. Therefore, the FDIC certifies that the proposed rule will not\nhave a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n64 The SBA defines a small banking organization as having $850 million or less in assets, where an\norganization\u2019s \u201cassets are determined by averaging the assets reported on its four quarterly financial statements for\nthe preceding year.\u201d See 13 CFR 121.201 (as amended by 87 FR 69118, effective December 19, 2022). In its\ndetermination, the \u201cSBA counts the receipts, employees, or other measure of size of the concern whose size is at\nissue and all of its domestic and foreign affiliates.\u201d See 13 CFR 121.103. Following these regulations, the FDIC\nuses an insured depository institution\u2019s affiliated and acquired assets, averaged over the preceding four quarters, to\ndetermine whether the insured depository institution is \u201csmall\u201d for the purposes of RFA.\n65 FDIC Call Report Data, December 31, 2024.\n31 The FDIC invites comments on all aspects of the supporting information provided in this\nRFA section. The FDIC is particularly interested in comments on any significant effects on\nsmall entities that the agency has not identified.\nOCC Unfunded Mandates Reform Act\nThe OCC has analyzed the proposed rule under the factors in the Unfunded Mandates\nReform Act of 1995 (UMRA).66 Under this analysis, the OCC considered whether the proposed\nrule includes a Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal\ngovernments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year\n($187 million as adjusted annually for inflation). Pursuant to section 202 of the UMRA,67 if a\nproposed rule meets this UMRA threshold, the OCC would need to prepare a written statement\nthat includes, among other things, a cost-benefit analysis of the proposal.\nBecause the 2023 CRA Final Rule did not take effect, the OCC used the 1995 CRA\nregulations as the baseline in its UMRA analysis. Using this baseline, the OCC estimates the\ncost of the proposal to be de minimis because the proposed rule would return to the 1995\nregulation, which is currently applicable to banks. Therefore, the OCC concludes that the\nproposed rule would not result in an expenditure of $187 million or more annually by state, local,\nand tribal governments, or by the private sector, and thus would not meet the UMRA threshold.\nAccordingly, the OCC has not prepared the written statement described in UMRA.\nRiegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994\nPursuant to section 302(a) of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory\nImprovement Act of 1994, 12 U.S.C. 4802(a), in determining the effective date and\nadministrative compliance requirements for new regulations that impose additional reporting,\n66 2 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.\n67 2 U.S.C. 1532.\n32 disclosure, or other requirements on insured depository institutions, the agencies will consider,\nconsistent with principles of safety and soundness and the public interest: (1) any administrative\nburdens that the proposed rule would place on depository institutions, including small depository\ninstitutions and customers of depository institutions; and (2) the benefits of the proposed rule.\nThe agencies request comment on any administrative burdens that the proposed rule would place\non depository institutions, including small depository institutions, and their customers, and the\nbenefits of the proposed rule that the agencies should consider in determining the effective date\nand administrative compliance requirements for a final rule.\nExecutive Orders 12866 and 14192\nExecutive Order 12866, as amended, provides that the Office of Information and\nRegulatory Affairs (OIRA) will review all \u201csignificant regulatory actions\u201d as defined therein.\nOIRA has determined that this proposal is not a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d for purposes of\nExecutive Order 12866. The proposal, if finalized as proposed, is not expected to be an\nExecutive Order 14192 regulatory action.\nPlain Language\nSection 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the agencies to use plain language\nin all proposed and final rules published after January 1, 2000. The agencies invite comment on\nhow to make this proposed rule easier to understand.\nFor example:\n\u2022 Have the agencies organized the material to inform your needs? If not, how could the\nagencies present the proposed rule more clearly?\n\u2022 Are the requirements in the proposed rule clearly stated? If not, how could the\nproposal be more clearly stated?\n33 \u2022 Does the proposed regulation contain technical language or jargon that is not clear?\nIf so, which language requires clarification?\n\u2022 Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, use of headings,\nparagraphing) make the proposed regulation easier to understand? If so, what\nchanges would achieve that?\n\u2022 Is this section format adequate? If not, which of the sections should be changed and\nhow?\n\u2022 What other changes can the agencies incorporate to make the proposed regulation\neasier to understand?\nPaperwork Reduction Act\nCertain provisions of the proposed rule contain \u201ccollections of information\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 through 3521. In\naccordance with the requirements of the PRA, the agencies may not conduct or sponsor, and the\nrespondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently\nvalid OMB control number. The information collections contained in the proposed rule have\nbeen submitted to OMB for review and approval by the OCC and the FDIC under section\n3507(d) of the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3507(d), and \u00a7 1320.11 of OMB\u2019s implementing regulations,\n5 CFR part 1320. The Board reviewed the proposed rule under the authority delegated to the\nBoard by OMB. The agencies are proposing to extend for three years, with revision, these\ninformation collections.\nTitle of Information Collection: OCC, Community Reinvestment Act; Board, Reporting,\nRecordkeeping, and Disclosure Requirements Associated with Regulation BB; FDIC,\nCommunity Reinvestment Act.\n34 OMB Control Numbers: OCC 1557-0160; Board 7100-0197; FDIC 3064-0092.\nFrequency of Response: On occasion.\nAffected Public: Businesses or other for-profits.\nRespondents:\nOCC: National banks, Federal savings associations, Federal branches and agencies.\nFDIC: All insured state nonmember banks, insured state-licensed branches of foreign\nbanks, insured state savings associations, and bank service providers.\nBoard: All state member banks (as defined in 12 CFR 208.2(g)), bank holding companies\n(as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1841), savings and loan holding companies (as defined in 12 U.S.C.\n1467a), foreign banking organizations (as defined in 12 CFR 211.21(o)), foreign banks that do\nnot operate an insured branch, state branch or state agency of a foreign bank (as defined in 12\nU.S.C. 3101(11) and (12)), Edge or agreement corporations (as defined in 12 CFR 211.1(c)(2)\nand (3)), and bank service providers.\nThe information collection requirements in the proposed rule are as follows:\nReporting Requirements\n\u00a7 __.25(b) - Request for designation as a wholesale or a limited purpose bank.

The appropriate Federal banking agency assesses the\nCRA performance of a bank or savings association in an examination as follows:\n59 (1) Lending, investment, and service tests. The appropriate Federal banking agency applies\nthe lending, investment, and service tests, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 25.22 through 25.24, in evaluating\nthe performance of a bank or savings association, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (3),\nand (4) of this section.\n(2) Community development test for wholesale or limited purpose banks and savings\nassociations. The appropriate Federal banking agency applies the community development test\nfor a wholesale or limited purpose bank or savings association, as provided in \u00a7 25.25, except as\nprovided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.\n(3) Small bank and savings association performance standards. The appropriate Federal\nbanking agency applies the small bank or savings association performance standards as provided\nin \u00a7 25.26 in evaluating the performance of a small bank or savings association or a bank or\nsavings association that was a small bank or savings association during the prior calendar year,\nunless the bank or savings association elects to be assessed as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (2),\nor (4) of this section. The bank or savings association may elect to be assessed as provided in\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section only if it collects and reports the data required for other banks or\nsavings associations under \u00a7 25.42.\n(4) Strategic plan. The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the performance of a\nbank or savings association under a strategic plan if the bank or savings association submits, and\nthe appropriate Federal banking agency approves, a strategic plan as provided in \u00a7 25.27.\n(b) Performance context. The appropriate Federal banking agency applies the tests and\nstandards in paragraph (a) of this section and also considers whether to approve a proposed\nstrategic plan in the context of:\n60 (1) Demographic data on median income levels, distribution of household income, nature of\nhousing stock, housing costs, and other relevant data pertaining to a bank\u2019s or savings\nassociation\u2019s assessment area(s);\n(2) Any information about lending, investment, and service opportunities in the bank\u2019s or\nsavings association\u2019s assessment area(s) maintained by the bank or savings association or\nobtained from community organizations, state, local, and tribal governments, economic\ndevelopment agencies, or other sources;\n(3) The bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s product offerings and business strategy as determined\nfrom data provided by the bank or savings association;\n(4) Institutional capacity and constraints, including the size and financial condition of the\nbank or savings association, the economic climate (national, regional, and local), safety and\nsoundness limitations, and any other factors that significantly affect the bank\u2019s or savings\nassociation\u2019s ability to provide lending, investments, or services in its assessment area(s);\n(5) The bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s past performance and the performance of similarly\nsituated lenders;\n(6) The bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s public file, as described in \u00a7 25.43, and any written\ncomments about the bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s CRA performance submitted to the bank or\nsavings association or the appropriate Federal banking agency; and\n(7) Any other information deemed relevant by the appropriate Federal banking agency.\n(c) Assigned ratings. The appropriate Federal banking agency assigns to a bank or savings\nassociation one of the following four ratings pursuant to \u00a7 25.28 and appendix A of this part:\n\u201coutstanding\u201d; \u201csatisfactory\u201d; \u201cneeds to improve\u201d; or \u201csubstantial noncompliance\u201d as provided in\n12 U.S.C. 2906(b)(2). The rating assigned by the appropriate Federal banking agency reflects the\n61 bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire\ncommunity, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and\nsound operation of the bank or savings association.\n(d) Safe and sound operations. This part and the CRA do not require a bank or savings\nassociation to make loans or investments or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe\nand sound operations. To the contrary, the appropriate Federal banking agency anticipates banks\nand savings associations can meet the standards of this part with safe and sound loans,\ninvestments, and services on which the banks and savings associations expect to make a profit.\nBanks and savings associations are permitted and encouraged to develop and apply flexible\nunderwriting standards for loans that benefit low- or moderate-income geographies or\nindividuals, only if consistent with safe and sound operations.\n(e) Low-cost education loans provided to low-income borrowers. In assessing and taking\ninto account the record of a bank or savings association under this part, the appropriate Federal\nbanking agency considers, as a factor, low-cost education loans originated by the bank or savings\nassociation to borrowers, particularly in its assessment area(s), who have an individual income\nthat is less than 50 percent of the area median income. For purposes of this paragraph, \u201clow-cost\neducation loans\u201d means any education loan, as defined in section 140(a)(7) of the Truth in\nLending Act (15 U.S.C. 1650(a)(7)) (including a loan under a State or local education loan\nprogram), originated by the bank or savings association for a student at an \u201cinstitution of higher\neducation,\u201d as that term is generally defined in sections 101 and 102 of the Higher Education Act\nof 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 and 1002) and the implementing regulations published by the U.S.\nDepartment of Education, with interest rates and fees no greater than those of comparable\n62 education loans offered directly by the U.S. Department of Education. Such rates and fees are\nspecified in section 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e).\n(f) Activities in cooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-\nincome credit unions. In assessing and taking into account the record of a nonminority-owned\nand nonwomen-owned bank or savings association under this part, the appropriate Federal\nbanking agency considers as a factor capital investment, loan participation, and other ventures\nundertaken by the bank or savings association in cooperation with minority- and women-owned\nfinancial institutions and low-income credit unions. Such activities must help meet the credit\nneeds of local communities in which the minority- and women-owned financial institutions and\nlow-income credit unions are chartered. To be considered, such activities need not also benefit\nthe bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s assessment area(s) or the broader statewide or regional\narea(s) that includes the bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s assessment area(s).\n\u00a7 25.22 Lending test.\n(a) Scope of test. (1) The lending test evaluates a bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s record of\nhelping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) through its lending activities by\nconsidering a bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s home mortgage, small business, small farm, and\ncommunity development lending. If consumer lending constitutes a substantial majority of a\nbank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s business, the appropriate Federal banking agency will evaluate\nthe bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s consumer lending in one or more of the following categories:\nmotor vehicle, credit card, other secured, and other unsecured loans. In addition, at a bank\u2019s or\nsavings association\u2019s option, the appropriate Federal banking agency will evaluate one or more\ncategories of consumer lending, if the bank or savings association has collected and maintained,\n63 as required in \u00a7 25.42(c)(1), the data for each category that the bank or savings association elects\nto have the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluate.\n(2) The appropriate Federal banking agency considers originations and purchases of loans.\nThe appropriate Federal banking agency will also consider any other loan data the bank or\nsavings association may choose to provide, including data on loans outstanding, commitments\nand letters of credit.\n(3) A bank or savings association may ask the appropriate Federal banking agency to\nconsider loans originated or purchased by consortia in which the bank or savings association\nparticipates or by third parties in which the bank or savings association has invested only if the\nloans meet the definition of community development loans and only in accordance with\nparagraph (d) of this section. The appropriate Federal banking agency will not consider these\nloans under any criterion of the lending test except the community development lending\ncriterion.\n(b) Performance criteria. The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a bank\u2019s or\nsavings association\u2019s lending performance pursuant to the following criteria:\n(1) Lending activity.

Activities considered under the lending or service tests may not be considered\nunder the investment test.\n(c) Affiliate investment. At a bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s option, the appropriate Federal\nbanking agency will consider, in its assessment of a bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s investment\nperformance, a qualified investment made by an affiliate of the bank or savings association, if\nthe qualified investment is not claimed by any other institution.\n(d) Disposition of branch premises.

A bank or savings association shall delineate one or more assessment areas\nwithin which the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the bank\u2019s or savings\n80 association\u2019s record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community. The appropriate\nFederal banking agency does not evaluate the bank\u2019s or savings association\u2019s delineation of its\nassessment area(s) as a separate performance criterion, but the appropriate Federal banking\nagency reviews the delineation for compliance with the requirements of this section.\n(b) Geographic area(s) for wholesale or limited purpose banks or savings associations. The\nassessment area(s) for a wholesale or limited purpose bank or savings association must consist\ngenerally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan\ndivision boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the\ndelineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or\ntowns, in which the bank or savings association has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking\nATMs.\n(c) Geographic area(s) for other banks and savings association.

The Board applies the tests and standards in paragraph (a) of this\nsection and also considers whether to approve a proposed strategic plan in the context of:\n(1) Demographic data on median income levels, distribution of household income, nature of\nhousing stock, housing costs, and other relevant data pertaining to a bank's assessment area(s);\n(2) Any information about lending, investment, and service opportunities in the bank's\nassessment area(s) maintained by the bank or obtained from community organizations, state,\nlocal, and tribal governments, economic development agencies, or other sources;\n(3) The bank's product offerings and business strategy as determined from data provided by\nthe bank;\n(4) Institutional capacity and constraints, including the size and financial condition of the\nbank, the economic climate (national, regional, and local), safety and soundness limitations, and\nany other factors that significantly affect the bank's ability to provide lending, investments, or\nservices in its assessment area(s);\n(5) The bank's past performance and the performance of similarly situated lenders;\n(6) The bank's public file, as described in \u00a7 228.43, and any written comments about the\nbank's CRA performance submitted to the bank or the Board; and\n(7) Any other information deemed relevant by the Board.\n(c) Assigned ratings. The Board assigns to a bank one of the following four ratings pursuant\nto \u00a7 228.28 and appendix A of this part: \u201coutstanding\u201d; \u201csatisfactory\u201d; \u201cneeds to improve\u201d; or\n127 \u201csubstantial noncompliance\u201d as provided in 12 U.S.C. 2906(b)(2). The rating assigned by the\nBoard reflects the bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community,\nincluding low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound\noperation of the bank.\n(d) Safe and sound operations. This part and the CRA do not require a bank to make loans\nor investments or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe and sound operations. To the\ncontrary, the Board anticipates banks can meet the standards of this part with safe and sound\nloans, investments, and services on which the banks expect to make a profit. Banks are permitted\nand encouraged to develop and apply flexible underwriting standards for loans that benefit low-\nor moderate-income geographies or individuals, only if consistent with safe and sound\noperations.\n(e) Low-cost education loans provided to low-income borrowers. In assessing and taking\ninto account the record of a bank under this part, the Board considers, as a factor, low-cost\neducation loans originated by the bank to borrowers, particularly in its assessment area(s), who\nhave an individual income that is less than 50 percent of the area median income. For purposes\nof this paragraph, \u201clow-cost education loans\u201d means any education loan, as defined in section\n140(a)(7) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1650(a)(7)) (including a loan under a state or\nlocal education loan program), originated by the bank for a student at an \u201cinstitution of higher\neducation,\u201d as that term is generally defined in sections 101 and 102 of the Higher Education Act\nof 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 and 1002) and the implementing regulations published by the U.S.\nDepartment of Education, with interest rates and fees no greater than those of comparable\neducation loans offered directly by the U.S. Department of Education. Such rates and fees are\nspecified in section 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e).\n128 (f) Activities in cooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-\nincome credit unions. In assessing and taking into account the record of a nonminority-owned\nand nonwomen-owned bank under this part, the Board considers as a factor capital investment,\nloan participation, and other ventures undertaken by the bank in cooperation with minority- and\nwomen-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions. Such activities must help\nmeet the credit needs of local communities in which the minority- and women-owned financial\ninstitutions and low-income credit unions are chartered. To be considered, such activities need\nnot also benefit the bank's assessment area(s) or the broader statewide or regional area that\nincludes the bank's assessment area(s).\n\u00a7 228.22 Lending test.\n(a) Scope of test.

The bank may elect to be assessed as\nprovided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if it collects and reports the data required for\nother banks under \u00a7 345.42.\n(4) Strategic plan. The FDIC evaluates the performance of a bank under a strategic plan if\nthe bank submits, and the FDIC approves, a strategic plan as provided in \u00a7 345.27.\n179 (b) Performance context. The FDIC applies the tests and standards in paragraph (a) of this\nsection and also considers whether to approve a proposed strategic plan in the context of:\n(1) Demographic data on median income levels, distribution of household income, nature of\nhousing stock, housing costs, and other relevant data pertaining to a bank\u2019s assessment area(s);\n(2) Any information about lending, investment, and service opportunities in the bank\u2019s\nassessment area(s) maintained by the bank or obtained from community organizations, State,\nlocal, and tribal governments, economic development agencies, or other sources;\n(3) The bank\u2019s product offerings and business strategy as determined from data provided by\nthe bank;\n(4) Institutional capacity and constraints, including the size and financial condition of the\nbank, the economic climate (national, regional, and local), safety and soundness limitations, and\nany other factors that significantly affect the bank\u2019s ability to provide lending, investments, or\nservices in its assessment area(s);\n(5) The bank\u2019s past performance and the performance of similarly situated lenders;\n(6) The bank\u2019s public file, as described in \u00a7 345.43, and any written comments about the\nbank\u2019s CRA performance submitted to the bank or the FDIC; and\n(7) Any other information deemed relevant by the FDIC.\n(c) Assigned ratings.

This part and the CRA do not require a bank to make loans or\ninvestments or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe and sound operations. To the\ncontrary, the FDIC anticipates banks can meet the standards of this part with safe and sound\nloans, investments, and services on which the banks expect to make a profit.

The FDIC takes into account any views expressed by interested parties\nthat are submitted in accordance with the FDIC\u2019s procedures set forth in part 303 of this chapter\nin considering CRA performance in an application listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.\n(d) Denial or conditional approval of application. A bank\u2019s record of performance may be\nthe basis for denying or conditioning approval of an application listed in paragraph (a) of this\nsection.\nSubpart C\u2014Records, Reporting, and Disclosure Requirements\n\u00a7 345.41 Assessment area delineation.\n(a) In general. A bank shall delineate one or more assessment areas within which the FDIC\nevaluates the bank\u2019s record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community. The FDIC does\nnot evaluate the bank\u2019s delineation of its assessment area(s) as a separate performance criterion,\nbut the FDIC reviews the delineation for compliance with the requirements of this section.\n196 (b) Geographic area(s) for wholesale or limited purpose banks. The assessment area(s) for a\nwholesale or limited purpose bank must consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan\ndivisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1\nof the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political\nsubdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns, in which the bank has its main office, branches,\nand deposit-taking ATMs.\n(c) Geographic area(s) for other banks. The assessment area(s) for a bank other than a\nwholesale or limited purpose bank must:\n(1) Consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or\nmetropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which\nthe delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties,\ncities, or towns; and\n(2) Include the geographies in which the bank has its main office, its branches, and its\ndeposit-taking RSFs, as well as the surrounding geographies in which the bank has originated or\npurchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage loans, small business and\nsmall farm loans, and any other loans the bank chooses, such as those consumer loans on which\nthe bank elects to have its performance assessed).\n(d) Adjustments to geographic area(s). A bank may adjust the boundaries of its assessment\narea(s) to include only the portion of a political subdivision that it reasonably can be expected to\nserve. An adjustment is particularly appropriate in the case of an assessment area that otherwise\nwould be extremely large, of unusual configuration, or divided by significant geographic\nbarriers.\n(e) Limitations on the delineation of an assessment area. Each bank\u2019s assessment area(s):\n197 (1) Must consist only of whole geographies;\n(2) May not reflect illegal discrimination;\n(3) May not arbitrarily exclude low- or moderate-income geographies, taking into account\nthe bank\u2019s size and financial condition; and\n(4) May not extend substantially beyond an MSA boundary or beyond a State boundary\nunless the assessment area is located in a multistate MSA. If a bank serves a geographic area that\nextends substantially beyond a State boundary, the bank shall delineate separate assessment areas\nfor the areas in each State. If a bank serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond\nan MSA boundary, the bank shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas inside and\noutside the MSA.\n(f) Banks serving military personnel. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a\nbank whose business predominantly consists of serving the needs of military personnel or their\ndependents who are not located within a defined geographic area may delineate its entire deposit\ncustomer base as its assessment area.\n(g) Use of assessment area(s). The FDIC uses the assessment area(s) delineated by a bank in\nits evaluation of the bank's CRA performance unless the FDIC determines that the assessment\narea(s) do not comply with the requirements of this section.\n\u00a7 345.42 Data collection, reporting, and disclosure.\n(a) Loan information required to be collected and maintained.

The FDIC rates an\nintermediate small bank\u2019s community development performance \u201coutstanding\u201d if the bank\ndemonstrates excellent responsiveness to community development needs in its assessment\narea(s) through community development loans, qualified investments, and community\ndevelopment services, as appropriate, considering the bank\u2019s capacity and the need and\navailability of such opportunities for community development in the bank\u2019s assessment area(s).\n(iii) Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings. An intermediate small bank\nmay also receive a community development test rating of \u201cneeds to improve\u201d or \u201csubstantial\nnoncompliance\u201d depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to meet the\nstandards for a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating.\n(3) Overall rating \u2014\n(i) Eligibility for a satisfactory overall rating. No intermediate small bank may receive an\nassigned overall rating of \u201csatisfactory\u201d unless it receives a rating of at least \u201csatisfactory\u201d on\nboth the lending test and the community development test.\n(ii) Eligibility for an outstanding overall rating.\n(A) An intermediate small bank that receives an \u201coutstanding\u201d rating on one test and at least\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d on the other test may receive an assigned overall rating of \u201coutstanding.\u201d\n(B) A small bank that is not an intermediate small bank that meets each of the standards for a\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d rating under the lending test and exceeds some or all of those standards may\n219 warrant consideration for an overall rating of \u201coutstanding.\u201d In assessing whether a bank\u2019s\nperformance is \u201coutstanding,\u201d the FDIC considers the extent to which the bank exceeds each of\nthe performance standards for a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating and its performance in making qualified\ninvestments and its performance in providing branches and other services and delivery systems\nthat enhance credit availability in its assessment area(s).\n(iii) Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance overall ratings. A small bank may also\nreceive a rating of \u201cneeds to improve\u201d or \u201csubstantial noncompliance\u201d depending on the degree\nto which its performance has failed to meet the standards for a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating.\n(e) Strategic plan assessment and rating \u2014\n(1) Satisfactory goals. The FDIC approves as \u201csatisfactory\u201d measurable goals that\nadequately help to meet the credit needs of the bank\u2019s assessment area(s).\n(2) Outstanding goals. If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable goals that\nsubstantially exceed the levels approved as \u201csatisfactory,\u201d the FDIC will approve those goals as\n\u201coutstanding.\u201d\n(3) Rating. The FDIC assesses the performance of a bank operating under an approved plan\nto determine if the bank has met its plan goals:\n(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC will rate\nthe bank\u2019s performance under the plan as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d\n(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its\nplan goals for an outstanding rating, the FDIC will rate the bank\u2019s performance under the plan as\n\u201coutstanding.\u201d\n(iii) If the bank fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC\nwill rate the bank as either \u201cneeds to improve\u201d or \u201csubstantial noncompliance,\u201d depending on the\n220 extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, unless the bank elected in its plan to be rated\notherwise, as provided in \u00a7 345.27(f)(4).\nAppendix B to Part 345\u2014CRA Notice\n(a) Notice for main offices and, if an interstate bank, one branch office in each state.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act Notice\nUnder the Federal Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) evaluates our record of helping to meet the credit needs of this community\nconsistent with safe and sound operations.

Gould today became the 32nd Comptroller of the Currency, after being sworn into the office by Dr. Michael Faulkender, Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. President Donald J. Trump nominated Mr. Gould on February 11, 2025, and the U.S. Senate confirmed him on July 10, 2025. Mr. Gould takes over from Rodney E. Hood, who has served as Acting Comptroller of the Currency for the past five months. Mr. Gould issued the following statement upon becoming Comptroller: It is a tremendous honor to serve as the 32nd Comptroller of the Currency. I am grateful to President Trump for his faith and confidence in nominating me. And I thank the Senate for confirming me last week, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent for his support throughout my confirmation process, and Deputy Secretary Dr. Michael Faulkender for administering the oath of office to me earlier today. I am delighted to return to the OCC where I last served as its Senior Deputy Comptroller and Chief Counsel from 2018 to 2021. As noted in my Senate testimony, I believe in President Lincoln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision of a national banking system that exists to support the U.S. economy. That system is today one of the crown jewels of American finance. But we should not take it for granted. As Comptroller, I will do everything in my power to ensure its continued relevance and ability to support the financial aspirations of all of us. I look forward to working with the dedicated and accomplished professionals of the agency to ensure a safe and sound banking system, improve bank supervision and regulation, embrace innovation, and promote fair access to financial services. I want to thank Rodney Hood for returning to public service and serving as Acting Comptroller of the Currency during the last five months. OCC employees have benefitted from his leadership guiding their work, and I wish him continued success. Prior to becoming Comptroller of the Currency, Mr. Gould was a partner at the law firm Jones Day. He previously served as the Senior Deputy Comptroller and Chief Counsel at the OCC and twice served on the staff of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, including as its chief counsel. He has spent the bulk of his career in the private sector as a consultant and lawyer, advising banks and other financial services firms on regulatory matters and risk management. Mr. Gould holds a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree from Princeton University and a law degree from Washington and Lee University. Media ContactStephanie Collins (202) 649-6870 Topic(s): About OCC",

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-69 | July 14, 2025 OCC Advances Key Priorities Under Acting Comptroller Rodney E. Hood Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five-month tenure at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) was marked by measurable progress in strengthening the federal banking system, reducing regulatory burden, promoting financial inclusion, expanding bank activities involving digital assets and embracing bank-fintech partnerships. \u00e2\u0080\u009cServing as the Acting Comptroller of the Currency has been the capstone of my career,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Hood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince my arrival, I demonstrated that \u00e2\u0080\u0098acting\u00e2\u0080\u0099 does not mean \u00e2\u0080\u0098inactive\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I am immensely proud of all the OCC has accomplished in a short amount of time to advance the safety, soundness and fairness of the federal banking system. The system is stronger, more resilient, more inclusive and more innovative today than when I arrived. It was my privilege to lead an agency of talented professionals, whose knowledge, expertise and creativity is unmatched in the financial services sector, and I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to them all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Strengthening the Federal Banking System and Supervisory Oversight The OCC focused on strengthening the federal banking system by directing several significant initiatives. April 18, 2025, the OCC announced conditional approval for the merger of Discover Bank into Capital One and highlighted its commitment to a regulatory framework that expands access to financial services for consumers, businesses and communities. June 9, 2025, the OCC released a letter reaffirming its support and defense of preemption as a cornerstone of the dual banking system that is fundamental to the operation of the federal banking system. June 16, 2025, federal bank regulatory agencies announced a request for comment on potential actions to help consumers, businesses, and financial institutions mitigate risk of payments fraud, with a particular focus on check fraud. Reducing Regulatory Burden The OCC worked diligently to promote a regulatory framework that is effective, not excessive. Feb. 11, 2025, the OCC announced its withdrawal from International Climate Organization and emphasized the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on fulfilling its core mission. March 20, 2025, the OCC announced it will no longer examine for reputation risk and will instead focus future examination activities on more transparent risk areas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 clarifying that the OCC has not and does not make business decisions for banks. March 31, 2025, the OCC withdrew principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions because they are overly burdensome and duplicative. The OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing guidance applies to all activities conducted by supervised institutions and includes potential exposures to severe weather events or natural disasters. April 16, 2025, Acting Comptroller Hood discussed agency priorities to reduce regulatory burden; promote financial inclusion; embrace bank-fintech partnerships; and expand responsible bank activities involving digital assets. May 8, 2025, an interim final rule on bank mergers restored the streamlined application and expedited review to the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s procedures for evaluating bank merger applications. This restoration makes it easier for well-managed and well-capitalized banks to merge, promotes competition, and facilitates economic growth and innovation. May 8, 2025, Acting Comptroller Hood discussed agency priorities, highlighting the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work to reduce regulatory burden, improve financial inclusion, support innovations in financial technology, and digital assets in the federal banking system. June 3, 2025, Acting Comptroller Hood discussed his regulatory agenda to embrace bank-fintech partnerships, expand bank activities involving digital assets, promote financial inclusion and reduce regulatory burden to support a dynamic banking sector that will enable individuals, communities and the economy to thrive and grow. June 25, 2025, Acting Comptroller Hood issued a statement supporting an interagency notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio to reduce burden and help promote the smooth functioning of U.S. Treasury markets. June 27, 2025, federal bank regulatory agencies requested comment on a proposal to modify certain regulatory capital standards to reduce disincentives for banking organizations to engage in lower-risk activities and promote the smooth functioning of U.S. Treasury markets. June 27, 2025, federal bank regulatory agencies issued an order granting an exemption from a requirement of the Customer Identification Program Rule permitting a bank or credit union to use an alternative collection method to obtain taxpayer identification number information from a third-party rather than from the customer. Acting Comptroller Hood issued a statement in support of the order, noting benefits to both consumers and the banking industry by promoting innovation and financial inclusion and providing banks more flexibility to operate in a manner that suits their business model. Promoting Financial Inclusion The OCC reinforced its commitment to financial inclusion as a regulatory objective and cornerstone of economic empowerment. March 24, 2025, Acting Comptroller Hood discussed financial inclusion, highlighting the work of OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Project REACh to support affordable homeownership. March 27, 2025, Acting Comptroller Hood encouraged innovation to foster financial inclusion in economically disadvantaged communities for both consumers and small businesses, particularly using financial technology tools. April 1, 2025, the OCC recognized April as National Financial Literacy Month and encouraged national banks and federal savings associations to support efforts to improve the financial literacy and financial health of their customers. April 30, 2025, Mr. Hood discussed how financial literacy helps drive the financial system and helps consumers build wealth for themselves and future generations. May 29, 2025, Acting Comptroller Hood discussed the importance of financial literacy education and encouraged banks to consider how they can support customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financial health. June 28, 2025, Mr. Hood reiterated homeownership as a pathway to financial inclusion and generational wealth in recognition of National Homeownership Month. Expanding Bank Activities with Digital Assets The OCC took several steps to provide clarity and expand bank activities with digital assets, while maintaining the safety, soundness and fairness of the federal banking system. March 7, 2025, Interpretive Letter 1183 confirmed that crypto-asset custody, certain stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as distributed ledger are permissible for national banks and federal savings associations. The letter also rescinded a cumbersome \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-objection\u00e2\u0080\u009d process imposed on banks prior to their engagement with digital assets. May 5, 2025, the OCC issued a Request for Information on community bank digitalization to better understand and address the specific obstacles that community banks encounter in the adoption and implementation of digital banking solutions. May 7, 2025, Interpretive Letter 1184 confirmed that national banks and federal savings associations may buy and sell assets held in custody at the customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction and are permitted to outsource to third parties bank-permissible crypto-asset activities, including custody and execution services. July 14, 2025, federal bank regulatory agencies provided clarity on banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 engagement in crypto-asset-related activities with a statement highlighting potential risk-management considerations related to holding crypto-assets on their customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behalf, or crypto-asset safekeeping. Embracing Bank-fintech Partnerships The OCC embraced bank-fintech partnerships and innovative ways to enhance customer experience and improve operational efficiency. March 17, 2025, the OCC announced conditional approval of a financial technology business model for a national bank. April 29, 2025, Acting Comptroller Hood discussed the role of artificial intelligence in financial services. Acting Comptroller Hood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenure at the OCC leaves a legacy of reform, innovative engagement with emerging technologies, and a focus on financial inclusion. His actions have supported a robust, fair, and future-ready federal banking system. Media ContactStephanie Collins (202) 649-6870 Topic(s): About OCC",

The statement highlights for banks potential risk-management considerations related to holding crypto-assets on their customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behalf, or crypto-asset safekeeping. The joint statement discusses existing risk-management principles that apply to crypto-asset safekeeping and reminds banks that provide or are considering providing safekeeping of such assets that they must do so in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

This statement discusses how existing laws, regulations,\nand risk-management principles5 apply to this activity, and does not create any new supervisory\nexpectations.\nBanking organizations may provide safekeeping for crypto-assets in a fiduciary or a non-\nfiduciary capacity.6 Banking organizations that provide crypto-asset safekeeping in a fiduciary\ncapacity must comply with 12 CFR 9 or 150, as applicable, state laws and regulations, and any\nother applicable legal provisions, such as the instrument that created the fiduciary relationship. A\nbanking organization providing safekeeping for crypto-assets in a fiduciary capacity\u2014such as a\ntrustee, an executor of a will, an administrator of an estate, or an investment advisor\u2014has the\nauthority to manage them in the same way banking organizations manage other assets they hold\nas fiduciaries.\n1 For the OCC, \u201cbanking organizations\u201d includes national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches and agencies\nof foreign banks. For the Board, \u201cbanking organizations\u201d includes all U.S. bank holding companies, state member banks, Edge\nand agreement corporations, and uninsured state-licensed branches and agencies of foreign banks. For the FDIC, \u201cbanking\norganizations\u201d includes all insured state nonmember banks, insured state-licensed branches of foreign banks, and insured state\nsavings associations.\n2 For the purposes of this statement, a crypto-asset generally refers to any digital asset implemented using cryptographic\ntechniques.\n3 By contrast, \u201ccustody\u201d encompasses all the services a banking organization may provide in relation to assets held on a\ncustomer\u2019s behalf. See OCC Interpretive Letter 1170 (July 22, 2020) (IL 1170) and the \u201cCustody Services\u201d booklet of the\nComptroller\u2019s Handbook.\n4 Id.\n5 See Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards, 12 CFR 30 Appendix B, 12 CFR 208 Appendix D-2;\n12 CFR 225 Appendix F (\u201cInformation Security Standards\u201d).\n6 Safekeeping services provided by a banking organization in a non-fiduciary capacity are established by the client contract. See\nthe \u201cCustody Services\u201d booklet of the Comptroller\u2019s Handbook.\n1 General Risk Management Considerations\nSafekeeping for crypto-assets entails controlling the cryptographic keys associated with the\ncrypto-asset in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations. As with all new\nproducts, services, and activities, banking organizations should consider potential risks prior to\noffering crypto-asset safekeeping.7 An effective risk assessment would consider such things as\nthe banking organization\u2019s (1) core financial risks given the strategic direction and business\nmodel; (2) ability to understand a complex, evolving, and potentially unfamiliar asset class,\nincluding by keeping abreast of industry leading practices;8 (3) ability to ensure a strong control\nenvironment; and (4) contingency plans to address any unanticipated challenges in effectively\nproviding services. Given the complexities of crypto-asset safekeeping, a banking organization\u2019s\nboard, officers, and employees should have the requisite knowledge and understanding of crypto-\nasset safekeeping services to establish adequate operational capacity and appropriate controls to\nconduct the activity in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations.\nA banking organization that is contemplating providing safekeeping for crypto-assets should\nconsider the evolving nature of the crypto-asset market, including the technology underlying the\ncrypto-assets, and implement a risk governance framework that appropriately adapts to relevant\nrisks. Providing crypto-asset safekeeping services may entail significant resources and attention,\nsuch as developing or procuring new technology, establishing a strong control environment, and\nensuring staff have appropriate technical expertise. In addition, crypto-assets may experience\nprice volatility, which could affect the demand for safekeeping services and the value of assets\nheld. Furthermore, rapid evolution in the market could affect the technology used to provide\nsafekeeping services.\nCryptographic Key Management\nOne of the primary risks of crypto-asset safekeeping is the possible compromise or loss of\ncryptographic keys or other sensitive information that could result in the loss of crypto-assets or\nthe unauthorized transfer of the crypto-assets out of the banking organization\u2019s control.9 In such\ncases, the banking organization faces the risk of being held liable for its customers\u2019 losses. Thus,\neffective safekeeping involves maintaining control of cryptographic keys and related sensitive\ninformation. In general, a banking organization assumes \u201ccontrol\u201d for purposes of safekeeping a\n7 See OCC Bulletin 2017-43: \u201cNew, Modified, or Expanded Banking Products and Services: Risk Management Principles\u201d\n(October 20, 2017).\n8 Banking organizations acting as fiduciaries are usually subject to heightened standards of care under applicable law in\ncomparison to non-fiduciaries. Given the continued evolution of the crypto-asset sector, banking organizations managing crypto-\nassets as fiduciaries should keep abreast of leading practices to meet these heightened standards.\n9 Most crypto-assets are transferred through cryptographic key pairs made up of unique alphanumeric codes. Key pairs consist of\na private key, which must be kept secret, and a public key, which may be shared in the context of a specific transaction.\n\u201cSensitive information\u201d includes any information that could be used to transfer crypto-assets, including \u201cseed phrases\u201d used to\nregenerate keys and other backup material.\n2 crypto-asset when it can reasonably demonstrate, consistent with the standard of care established\nby applicable law, that no other party\u2014including the customer\u2014has access to information\nsufficient to unilaterally transfer the crypto-asset out of the control of the banking organization.\nTo establish initial control of a crypto-asset, a banking organization will usually require the asset\nto be transferred to the banking organization on the asset\u2019s underlying distributed ledger.10 A\nbanking organization would apply these same control standards to any sub-custodian used to\nperform crypto-asset safekeeping functions on the banking organization\u2019s behalf.11\nAdditional risk management issues related to cryptographic key management may include the\nsecure generation of cryptographic keys12 and contingency planning for lost or compromised\nkeys. Effective risk management includes determining whether the banking organization\u2019s key\nmanagement systems continue to be sufficient in light of technological developments,13 resulting\nin the need for ongoing and dynamic product development and risk management programs. This\nmay result in additional investment in technology to provide continued service.\nGiven the virtual nature of crypto-assets, and the potentially increased operational risks\nassociated with crypto-asset safekeeping, a banking organization\u2019s cybersecurity environment\nshould be a key focus of risk management.14\nAdditional Risk Management Considerations\nEffective risk management also includes appropriate processes for determining the specific\ncrypto-assets for which the banking organization will provide safekeeping,15 especially as\n10 A banking organization that simply takes possession of existing cryptographic keys may not have control of the assets, since,\nfor example, a customer may have retained copies of the keys or given them to others.\n11 See OCC Bulletin 2002\u201316, \u201cBank Use of Foreign-Based Third-Party Service Providers: Risk Management Guidance.\u201d\n12 A discussion of cryptographic key generation is beyond the scope of this document. Among other resources, the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has made recommendations on cryptographic key generation that may be an\nappropriate reference. Although keys may be generated by widely available cryptographic wallets, a banking organization may\ndetermine that such keys do not meet the requirements of its control environment.\n13 Cryptographic keys are often kept in \u201cwallets,\u201d which exist in numerous forms and have various technical specifications.\nGenerally, wallets exist on a continuum between \u201ccold\u201d wallets permanently disconnected from the internet and \u201chot\u201d wallets\nthat remain online at all times. As a general proposition, wallets that are more easily accessible may be less secure. See IL 1170.\nNot all wallets are compatible with all crypto-assets.\n14 OCC Bulletin 2023-22 \u201cCybersecurity Supervision Work Program,\u201d provides considerations aligned with existing supervisory\nguidance and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.\n15 A banking organization should address the risks associated with a safekeeping account before acceptance. See, e.g., the OCC\u2019s\n\u201cCustody Services\u201d booklet of the Comptroller\u2019s Handbook. For fiduciary accounts administered by national banks and FSAs,\nthese reviews are required by regulation. See 12 CFR 9.6(a); 12 CFR 150.200.\n3 different types of crypto-assets may require different key management solutions.16 Crypto-assets\nmay feature software or hardware with which the banking organization may be inexperienced or\nthat does not readily integrate with its current technology environment. Sound practices typically\ninclude performing a comprehensive analysis of each crypto-asset before safekeeping that\ncrypto-asset, including for example, by identifying vulnerabilities and dependencies that could\ncreate material risks to the banking organization\u2019s safety and soundness. Effective risk\nmanagement practices may also entail analyzing relevant technical, operational, strategic,\nmarket, legal, and compliance considerations relating to each crypto-asset and its underlying\nledger as well as staying apprised of material developments specifically related to supported\ncrypto-assets and their underlying ledgers.17\nThe provision of crypto-asset safekeeping entails the maintenance of an effective control\nenvironment, including appropriate risk management oversight and independent assurance\nconducted on a regular basis by individuals with the requisite expertise. Standard custodial risk\nmanagement principles apply to the storage of cryptographic keys and sensitive information, but\nthey may need to be tailored to the specific services provided.18 Banking organizations should\ncarefully consider the potential risks associated with the different types of account models\n(omnibus versus separate accounts) for safekeeping crypto-assets.19\nLegal and Compliance Risk\nLike all other banking activities, crypto-asset safekeeping relationships are subject to applicable\nBank Secrecy Act\/anti-money laundering (BSA\/AML), countering the financing of terrorism\n(CFT), and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requirements. 20 These laws and\nregulations require banking organizations to verify customer identity, perform due diligence to\nunderstand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship, perform ongoing monitoring to\nidentify and report suspicious activity, block transactions in accordance with OFAC sanctions,\n16 Crypto-assets may have varying technical attributes, may exist on ledgers that are incompatible with each other, and may have\nbeen created through open-source or other less-formalized processes that would not require specific disclosures. Key\nmanagement solutions refers to the tools, technologies, and systems used to implement a key management strategy.\n17 See, e.g., FFIEC Guidance on Risk Management of Free and Open Source Software (Oct. 21, 2004).\n18 12 CFR 9 and 150 apply to the fiduciary activities of national banks and FSAs, respectively, including when they offer\nsafekeeping in a fiduciary capacity.; For additional information, see IL 1170 and the \u201cCustody Services\u201d booklet of the\nComptroller\u2019s Handbook.\n19 Omnibus accounts may permit greater efficiencies but could also create larger targets for theft. A banking organization using a\nseparate account model might hold individual customer keys in separate, dedicated wallets, which could require the generation\nand management of a greater number of key pairs.\n20 Banking organizations must establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with\nBSA regulatory requirements, which should be commensurate with the institution\u2019s size, complexity, and business activities. See,\ne.g., 12 CFR 21.21, 208.63.\n4 and follow the \u201cTravel Rule.\u201d 21 The design features of distributed ledger technology may\npresent challenges for achieving or maintaining compliance with certain of these requirements22\nif compliance depends on review of the identifying information (for example, name and address)\nrelated to a transaction.23 Before offering crypto-asset safekeeping, a banking organization\nshould appropriately involve its BSA officer, board of directors (or designated committee), and\nsenior management in assessing potential money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit\nfinancial activity risks.\nCrypto-asset safekeeping may involve elevated levels of compliance and legal risks due to the\nevolving regulatory landscape. Banking organizations seeking to engage in these activities\nshould ensure the activities are conducted consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.24 A\nwell-written customer agreement, outlining clearly defined duties and responsibilities of the\nparties, is an important tool to manage the risks of crypto-asset safekeeping and may be used to\naddress issues specific to this service, such as on-chain governance and voting,25 forks,26\nairdrops,27 probabilistic settlement that may be characteristic of permissionless blockchains,28\nthe method of holding the assets (cold\/hot\/hybrid storage), the use of a sub-custodian(s), and the\nuse of smart contracts.29\nCrypto-asset safekeeping activities present a risk that the customer could be misinformed of the\nbanking organization\u2019s role in the arrangement. Banking organizations may be able to mitigate\nthis risk by providing clear, accurate, and timely information to customers about their crypto-\nasset safekeeping activities, including the banking organization\u2019s role in any governance or other\nvoting matter related to the crypto-asset. A banking organization providing crypto-asset\n21 31 CFR 103.33(g).\n22 31 CFR 1010.410.\n23 See the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) publication \u201cVirtual Assets: Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF\nStandards on VAs and VASPs.\u201d\n24 See the \u201cCorporate and Risk Governance\u201d booklet of the Comptroller\u2019s Handbook.\n25 On-chain governance is an integrated voting system for managing and implementing changes to crypto-asset blockchains.\n26 A \u201cfork\u201d occurs when not all participants support a change to the rules governing a crypto-asset\u2019s ledger. This effectively\ncauses the ledger to split in two, with one ledger following the new rules and one following the old rules.\n27 An \u201cairdrop\u201d is a distribution of crypto-assets to wallets, typically for no financial consideration.\n28 In permissionless blockchains, settlement can be probabilistic, meaning the probability of a transaction being revoked or\nreversed converges to zero but never fully reaches it as time progresses.\n29 Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions\nare met. If the crypto-assets under custody depend on smart contracts, a banking organization should exercise appropriate\ngovernance and oversight of these smart contracts throughout their life cycle.\n5 safekeeping must follow applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Evolving tax laws\nmay also affect customer obligations in relation to crypto-asset safekeeping.\nThird-Party Risk Management\nIn certain circumstances, a banking organization may choose to contract with one or more third-\nparty sub-custodians or other service providers (e.g., technology providers, cash management) to\nprovide safekeeping for crypto-assets.30 A banking organization employing a sub-custodian for\ncrypto-asset safekeeping should understand the benefits and risks associated with engaging sub-\ncustodians, applicable laws and regulations, and relevant third-party risk management\nguidance.31\nThird-party risk management processes should be commensurate with the risk posed by the\nactivity performed. Subject to the terms and conditions in the customer agreement, a banking\norganization is responsible for the activities performed by the sub-custodian.32 This\nresponsibility includes decisions around selecting the crypto-assets for which custodial services\nwill be provided, even if the sub-custodian assists in analyzing the crypto-assets and their\nunderlying ledgers on the banking organization\u2019s behalf. Conducting due diligence before\nselection of a sub-custodian is an important part of sound risk management, and includes\nevaluating the effectiveness of the sub-custodian\u2019s cryptographic key-management solution,\nincluding polices, processes, and internal controls, as well as its adherence to standard\nsafekeeping risk management practices.33 Appropriate risk management may include analyzing\nthe potential treatment of customer assets held at the sub-custodian in the event of insolvency or\noperational disruptions and evaluating the appropriateness of the sub-custodian\u2019s risk\nmanagement and recordkeeping practices.34\nA banking organization that opts to provide crypto-asset safekeeping directly without using a\nsub-custodian may still choose to use third parties in other ways, including through the use of\n30 These third parties, or sub-custodians, may provide services through various models, including API-based integrations or by\nwhite labeling their underlying platform to the client.\n31 See OCC Bulletin 2002\u201316.\n32 A banking organization could consider including in contracts with a sub-custodian the circumstances under which the banking\norganization will be notified of material events. In the context of safekeeping crypto-assets, this could include any potential\ncompromise of cryptographic keys or sensitive information, any necessary use of backup information, or material transaction\nerrors that cannot be reversed.\n33 These may include segregation of the sub-custodian\u2019s crypto-assets from those of the banking organization, dual control,\nseparation of duties, and other appropriate technical or physical controls.\n34 For example, it would be inconsistent with appropriate risk management for a sub-custodian to commingle its own assets with\nassets being held on behalf of the banking organization, as this could risk the crypto-assets being treated as property of the sub-\ncustodian in certain circumstances, such as bankruptcy. Similarly, if a sub-custodian fails to maintain proper recordkeeping or\ncontingency planning, an operational disruption could prevent the banking organization\u2019s customers from being able to access\ntheir crypto-assets, potentially for an extended period of time or even permanently.\n6 third-party technology. Effective risk management of third-party technology in this context will\ngenerally include weighing the risks of purchasing third-party software or hardware versus\nmaintaining such software or hardware as a service.\nAudit\nAudit programs are essential to effective risk management and internal control systems. As such,\na banking organization\u2019s audit program should provide appropriate coverage over the banking\norganization\u2019s crypto-asset safekeeping activities, including third-party risk management as\napplicable. A crypto-asset safekeeping audit should address the nuances of crypto-assets,\nincluding an assessment of cryptographic key generation, storage, and deletion; controls related\nto transfer and settlement of customer assets; and the sufficiency of relevant information\ntechnology systems.35 Audits may assess management and staff expertise, including the ability to\nidentify and control the unique risks associated with crypto-asset products and services, as well\nas the implementation of safekeeping controls. When audit expertise does not exist within the\nbanking organization, management should engage appropriate external resources, with sufficient\nindependence, to assess crypto-asset safekeeping operations.\n35 Insured depository institutions should have an internal audit system appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and\nscope of the institution\u2019s activities. Among other things, the internal audit system should provide for adequate monitoring of the\nsystem of internal controls through an internal audit function. For an institution whose size, complexity or scope of operations\ndoes not warrant a full-scale internal audit function, a system of independent reviews of key internal controls may be used.

    "cleaned_text":"Remarks of Rodney E. Hood\nActing Comptroller of the Currency\nAt the Homebuyers Fair\nDetroit, Michigan\nJune 28, 2025\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen! It is an absolute privilege to join you today at the Detroit\nREACh Homebuyers Fair.\nJune is National Homeownership Month, a time to recognize the vital role that homeownership\nplays in building stronger communities, expanding access to economic opportunity, and\nempowering individuals and families through financial stability and generational wealth. This\nimportant gathering serves as a testament to our shared commitment to advancing\nhomeownership. I\u2019m excited to share insights into the OCC\u2019s current priorities with this\nesteemed group of visionaries, advocates, and leaders who are as committed to financial\ninclusion and advancing homeownership as I am.\nI\u2019d like to begin with the words of Maya Angelou, who said, \u201cHistory, despite its wrenching\npain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.\u201d\nThis is our charge today, as we bear witness to needs and opportunities here in Detroit and\nelsewhere across the nation.\nI grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, in a community where faith was strong, neighborhoods\nwere tight, and opportunity often felt like it lived somewhere else. My grandparents endured the\nindignities of Jim Crow. My parents integrated schools and workplaces, not just for themselves\n\u2014 but for all of us. And I \u2014 like so many others \u2014 came of age in rooms where I had to prove I belonged before I\neven said a word. I\u2019ve been in boardrooms and briefing rooms, and I\u2019ve advised presidents and\nfaced congressional scrutiny. But none of that compares to what I carry with me every single\nday: The lived experience of what it means to defy expectations and to fight for fair access and\ninclusion.\nThe mission of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is to ensure that national\nbanks and federal savings associations operate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair access to\nfinancial services, treat customers fairly, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nCentral to this mission, as we work with banks large and small, is our unwavering dedication to\nfinancial inclusion. This is a priority that I hold in the highest regard.\nOCC examiners supervise more than 1,000 national banks and federal savings associations that\ncollectively hold nearly $16 trillion (with a \u201cT\u201d) in assets. These institutions represent two-thirds\nof the U.S. banking system and play a significant role in supporting individual and household\nfinancial health, entrepreneurship, and broad-based economic growth. The institutions we\nsupervise range from the largest publicly traded global, corporate stock institutions to smaller\nmember-owned mutual institutions. Every single one of these institutions has an opportunity\u2014\nindeed I would call it an imperative\u2014to advance the objectives of financial inclusion and to\npositively affect unbanked and underbanked individuals by bringing them into the banking\nmainstream.\nThe OCC also proudly serves on the board of directors of NeighborWorks America, one of the\nnation\u2019s leading organizations for affordable housing and community development.\nNeighborWorks America\u2019s network of nearly 250 community development organizations located\nin all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and on Native lands is focused on scaling\nsolutions that work and deepen impact in communities nationwide. The network organizations\ncombine proven practices with creative solutions to open pathways to affordable sustainable\nhomeownership that is a recognized tool for building wealth. NeighborWorks organizations meet\nfirst-time homebuyers where they are and help them navigate a very complex home buying\nprocess. This includes providing everything from pre-purchase education and counseling to\n2 down payment assistance and closing cost assistance to post-purchase services. One of our\nDetroit REACh partners, MiSide, is a NeighborWorks affiliate.\nMs. Angelou urges us to learn from the past. I am heartened that the origin of the OCC\ncontinues to be applicable and relevant today. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and\nthe national banking system were founded in 1863, when the National Currency Act was passed\nby Congress and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln. As President Lincoln said in a\nmessage to Congress in 1864, the national banking system will \u201ccreate a reliable and permanent\ninfluence in support of the national credit.\u201d I can attest that, more than 160 years later, the OCC\ncontinues to live up to this charge.\nFinancial inclusion is a cornerstone of economic empowerment. It ensures that individuals and\ncommunities have access to the financial tools and resources necessary to build wealth, invest in\neducation, start businesses, and, importantly, achieve homeownership. Homeownership, as many\nof you know, is not merely about possessing property; it is about establishing roots, fostering\ncommunity stability, and creating opportunities for generational wealth.\nGenerational wealth, or the assets passed down from one generation to the next, plays a pivotal\nrole in breaking the cycle of poverty and building economic resilience. Homeownership has\nhistorically been one of the most effective vehicles for accumulating and transferring this wealth.\nHowever, economic barriers have long prevented many people from accessing homeownership\nopportunities, thereby hindering their ability to build and sustain wealth over generations.\nRecognizing this and other challenges, the OCC launched Project REACh\u2014which stands for the\nRoundtable for Economic Access and Change\u2014in July 2020. I know many of you are familiar\nwith this public-private collaboration that brings together leaders in banking, civil rights,\ncommunity development, and technology to forge actionable solutions. Through collaborative\nefforts, Project REACh aims to promote innovative solutions that advance financial inclusion at\nthe national and local levels.\n3 Our workstreams focus on expanding affordable housing, growing small businesses, supporting\nlocalized financial inclusion solutions, and leveraging fintech for financial empowerment.\nProject REACh has already delivered results\u2014including expanding credit for those with no\ncredit score, increasing investment in minority depository institutions, and tackling the\nchallenges that limit full and fair economic participation.\nOne of the critical areas of focus for Project REACh is affordable homeownership. By\naddressing the challenges that disadvantaged and underserved consumers face in purchasing\nhomes, and by encouraging the development of innovative products and services that improve\naccess to credit, REACh members strive to make homeownership attainable. This endeavor is\nnot just about increasing homeownership rates; it is about ensuring that the dream of owning a\nhome, and the benefits of stability and wealth creation, are accessible to every individual,\nregardless of their background or economic status.\nI\u2019m thrilled that Project REACh participants have several specific initiatives under way to\nexpand affordable homeownership, including down payment assistance programs and innovative\nmortgage products tailored to help first-time home buyers. Additionally, member organizations\nare enhancing home buyer counseling so that prospective homeowners can successfully navigate\na complicated process. By fostering meaningful partnerships and encouraging creative problem-\nsolving, Project REACh can empower more Americans to achieve homeownership and build\ngenerational wealth.\nI want to express my deep appreciation for the work that National Faith Homebuyers, MiSide,\nand Detroit Future City do every day. Your dedication to promoting sustainable homeownership\nin the Detroit community and beyond is instrumental in shaping a more equitable housing\nlandscape. Together, by aligning our efforts and sharing our expertise, we can create pathways to\nfinancial inclusion and generational wealth.\nI want to close by issuing a challenge to all who are here today to leave this conference refueled\nby purpose. Return to your communities recommitted to building opportunities for economic\ninclusion and continue to explore innovative solutions to foster homeownership and generational\n4 wealth. Working together, we can all demonstrate the courage that Maya Angelou referred to, in\norder to create a legacy of change.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.\n5",

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-63 | June 30, 2025 OCC Report Highlights Key Risks in Federal Banking System Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today reported the key issues facing the federal banking system in its Semiannual Risk Perspective for Spring 2025. The OCC reported that the strength of the federal banking system remains sound. Consumer sentiment, geopolitical risk, sustained higher interest rates, and downward movement in some macroeconomic indicators have increased economic uncertainty. The OCC also affirmed that the adoption of new technologies, products, and services and\/or engagement with financial technology companies to deliver banking products and services can offer benefits to banks and customers. The OCC highlighted credit, market, operational, and compliance risks, as the key risk themes in the report. Highlights from the report include: Commercial credit risk is increasing, driven by growing geopolitical risk, sustained higher interest rates, growing caution among businesses and their customers, and other macroeconomic uncertainty. Pockets of risk remain for some commercial real estate property types and vary by geographic market and product type. Refinance risk remains high for loans underwritten during a period of lower interest rates. Retail credit risk remains stable despite economic uncertainty. Most consumer borrower segments continue to withstand elevated prices, interest rates, and growing debt levels, supported in part by growth in wages exceeding aggregate inflation since 2019. However, wage growth is decelerating, and economic uncertainty is driving adverse changes in consumer sentiment. Regarding market risk, net interest margins in OCC-supervised institutions improved in the latter half of 2024 as effective federal funds rate (EFFR) cuts enabled banks to lower funding costs. Robust interest rate risk scenario analysis and sensitivity testing are critical due to uncertainty surrounding inflation and future EFFR movement. Asset-based liquidity was stable in 2024, but unrealized investment portfolio losses remain a focus. Deposits were also stable, but deposit competition warrants continued monitoring. Operational risk is elevated. Banks continue to seek opportunities to gain efficiencies and respond to an evolving and increasingly complex operating environment. Failure to upgrade systems and digitize may result in loss of market share to competitors offering faster and cheaper payment alternatives. Criminals continue to exploit traditional payment methods. Fraud schemes commonly target checks, wire transfers, peer-to-peer payment platforms, and insiders. Evolving cyber threats by sophisticated malicious actors continue to target banks and their key service providers, emphasizing the importance of operational resilience. Recent disruptions across many sectors, including the financial sector, highlight the importance of sound third-party risk management. Compliance risk remains elevated due in part to Bank Secrecy Act\/anti-money laundering and consumer compliance risks associated with elevated fraud levels; account access concerns, and evolving business models. The report covers risks facing national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies based on data as of December 31, 2024, unless otherwise indicated. The report presents information in three main areas: trends in key risks, operating environment, and bank performance. The report focuses on issues that pose threats to those financial institutions regulated by the OCC and is intended as a resource to the industry, examiners, and the public.

This represents\nthe totality of OCC-supervised banks. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFEDERAL BANKING SYSTEM KEY THEMES\nThe strength of the federal banking system remains sound. Consumer sentiment,\ngeopolitical risk, sustained higher interest rates, and downward movement in some\nmacroeconomic indicators have increased economic uncertainty.\nCommercial credit risk is increasing. This is driven by growing geopolitical risk, sustained\nhigher interest rates, growing caution among businesses and their customers, and other\nmacroeconomic uncertainty. Pockets of risk remain for some commercial real estate (CRE)\nproperty types and vary by geographic market and product type. Refinance risk remains high\nfor loans underwritten during a period of lower interest rates.\nRetail credit risk remains stable despite economic uncertainty. Most consumer borrower\nsegments continue to withstand elevated prices, interest rates, and growing debt levels,\nsupported in part by growth in wages exceeding aggregate inflation since 2019. However,\nwage growth is decelerating, and economic uncertainty is driving adverse changes in\nconsumer sentiment.\nMarket and liquidity risk are stable. Net interest margins (NIM) in OCC-supervised banks\nimproved in the latter half of 2024 as effective federal funds rate (EFFR) cuts enabled banks\nto lower funding costs. Robust interest rate risk (IRR) scenario analysis and sensitivity testing\nare critical due to uncertainty surrounding inflation and future EFFR movement. Asset-\nbased liquidity was stable in 2024, but unrealized investment portfolio losses remain a focus.\nDeposits were also stable, but deposit competition warrants continued monitoring.\nOperational risk is elevated. Banks continue to seek opportunities to gain efficiencies and\nrespond to an evolving and increasingly complex operating environment. Failure to upgrade\nsystems and digitize may result in loss of market share to competitors offering faster and\ncheaper payment alternatives. Criminals continue to exploit traditional payment methods.\nFraud schemes commonly target checks, wire transfers, peer-to-peer payment platforms, and\ninsiders. Evolving cyber threats by sophisticated malicious actors continue to target banks\nand their key service providers, emphasizing the importance of operational resilience. Recent\ndisruptions across many sectors, including the financial sector, highlight the importance of\nsound third-party risk management.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 1 Compliance risk remains elevated. This is due in part to Bank Secrecy Act\/anti-money\nlaundering (BSA\/AML) and consumer compliance risks associated with elevated fraud levels,\naccount access concerns, and evolving business models.\nAdoption of new technologies, products, and services, and\/or engagement with\nfinancial technology companies (fintechs) to deliver banking products and services, can\noffer benefits to banks and customers. These benefits can include, gaining efficiencies,\nfurthering digitalization efforts, and meeting evolving customer expectations. That said,\nthese engagements potentially introduce complexities to the operating environment, with\nimplications for banks\u2019 governance, change management, and risk management programs.\nGLOBAL AND DOMESTIC ECONOMIC\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT\nGlobal economic growth is forecast to slow in 2025 with uncertainty stemming from trade\npolicy and geopolitical tensions. Moreover, asynchronous monetary policy decisions by global\ncentral banks could result in currency and bond market volatility.\nAfter the brief pandemic-era recession in the second quarter of 2020, U.S. real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) has grown solidly and, by the first quarter of 2025, was 12 percent above its\npre-pandemic peak in the fourth quarter of 2019. Payroll employment in April of this year was\n55 million above its pre-pandemic peak, while unemployment remains near historical lows, at\n4.2 percent. However, the first quarter of 2025 saw a slight decline in economic activity, driven\nby a sizeable increase in the volume of imports. At the same time, job creation continued at\npre-pandemic levels, with 177,000 jobs created in April 2025.\nThe near-term economic outlook remains cautious as economic uncertainty has grown. Some\nforecasters note that consumers appear poised to slow spending as households have depleted\nmuch of their excess savings built up during the pandemic, wage growth continues to slow,\nand job gains have eased. The Blue Chip Consensus Forecast3 (the Consensus) projects\nfull-year growth to be 1.2 percent in 2025 and 1.3 percent in 2026. The Consensus projects\npersonal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation to accelerate to 3.6 percent at an annual rate\nby the third quarter of 2025. By the fourth quarter of 2026, PCE inflation is projected to fall\nto 2.2 percent, only slightly above the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s\n(Federal Reserve) 2 percent target.\n3 Developed by Wolters Kluwer.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 2 BANK PERFORMANCE\nProfitability for the federal banking system was stable in 2024. For 2025, the earnings\noutlook will depend on how banks navigate an uncertain economic climate and the future\npath of interest rates. The federal banking system remains resilient and well-positioned to\nabsorb stress, with capital ratios and liquidity high by historical standards.\nRecent changes in banks\u2019 balance sheets have positioned banks to potentially benefit more from\na decline in interest rates relative to prior periods when the Federal Reserve lowered rates.\nLoan growth for the federal banking system remained weak in 2024, growing by 1.6 percent.\nBehind the tepid growth was a decline in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans. Federal\nbanking system deposits grew at the same pace as loans, 1.6 percent. The loan-to-deposit\nratio (LTD), one measure of liquidity, remained below the pre-pandemic level for the federal\nbanking system. For banks with assets less than $10 billion, LTD ratios have nearly returned\nto pre-pandemic levels.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 3 PART I\nT R E N D S I N K E Y R I S K S\nA. CREDIT RISK\nCOMMERCIAL CREDIT\nCommercial credit risk is increasing, driven by growing geopolitical risk, sustained higher interest rates,\ngrowing caution among businesses and their customers, and other macroeconomic uncertainty. This\nenvironment may implicate certain effective risk management practices, including prudent concentration\nrisk management, loan- and portfolio-level stress testing, accurate risk ratings, and appropriate allowance\nfor credit losses (ACL) methodologies.\nPockets of risk remain for some CRE property types and vary by geographic market and product type. The\nmultifamily market is projected to stabilize later this year and the industrial market is expected to stabilize\nwithin the next 12 to 18 months. Office vacancies are projected to continue to rise into 2026, and property\nvalues may continue a slow decline before stabilizing. Hotel performance is bifurcated by asset class.\nEconomy hotels continue to experience declines in demand, while luxury hotels are experiencing demand\ngrowth. Regardless of asset class, average daily room rates remain below pre-pandemic averages, reflecting\nlimited pricing power in hospitality. Retail properties, except malls, continue to remain in demand due to\nlimited new supply. Banks have generally recognized the riskiest CRE properties and have written down\nloans or put in place loss mitigation strategies. However, geopolitical risks and economic uncertainties\nremain that have the potential to impact various type of CRE properties.\nRefinance risk remains high for loans underwritten during a period of lower interest rates and to companies\nwith higher leverage and marginal repayment capacity, smaller and lower-rated firms with near-term debt\nmaturities, and firms with limited financial flexibility. Refinance risk is also high for CRE loans underwritten\nduring the period of lower interest rates, often with interest-only terms. These loans are typically secured by\nproperties with significant declines in property values or lower net operating income (NOI).\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 4 Trade disruptions due to tariffs and geopolitical risks may compress margins across numerous industries\nwith lower ability to pass through costs on imported goods and materials. In addition, industries with heavy\nexports may be adversely affected by changes in global tariff policies.\nGiven the continuing growth in private capital markets, examiners continue to monitor banks\u2019 involvement\nin venture lending activity and novel lending structures to private capital providers, such as net asset value\nand hybrid facilities.\nAgricultural commodity prices remain below the long-term average, increasing risk to banks with\nconcentrations in agricultural lending. While farm bankruptcies have increased, farm cash income is\nexpected to increase in 2025 due to government disaster assistance payments and a modest decrease\nin expenses. Increased farmland values support a relatively low debt-to-assets ratio across agricultural\nborrowers. However, agricultural producers heavily reliant on export products, such as soybeans and corn,\nmay experience additional challenges from changes in global trade policies.\nRETAIL CREDIT\nRetail credit performance remains satisfactory, and overall retail credit risk is stable. Most consumer\nsegments continue to withstand elevated prices and interest rates, supported in part by growth in wages\nexceeding aggregate inflation since 2019. However, wage growth is decelerating and economic uncertainty\nis driving adverse changes in consumer sentiment. This adverse sentiment has the potential to impact\npersonal consumption, which has been one of the main drivers of past, robust GDP growth.\nCurrently, bank delinquency and loss rates remain manageable. Consumers continue payment prioritization\nof low-rate mortgage loans with historically low, albeit increasing, levels of delinquency and loss rates.\nDelinquencies in other retail asset classes, namely credit cards and automobile loans, reflect an increasing\ntrend, but are forecast to stabilize during the first half of 2025. However, delinquency rates may be higher\nthan reported due to some banks temporarily freezing delinquencies to provide borrowers time to qualify\nfor the re-aging of accounts as part of loan workout programs. Such practices can be used to help borrowers\novercome temporary financial difficulties but can obscure the true delinquency status of the portfolio if not\nprudently structured and controlled.4\nBanks reported tighter lending standards for the year across most categories of consumer lending. Portfolio\ngrowth was generally flat for 2024 across all consumer portfolios. Flat loan growth, desire to increase\nlending margins, and current housing and automobile affordability challenges may impact a bank\u2019s credit risk\nappetite. Changing market and economic conditions can also affect the performance of retail credit models.\n4 Refer to OCC Bulletin 2000-20, \u201cUniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy,\u201d and OCC Bulletin\n2023-11, \u201cCurrent Expected Credit Losses: Interagency Policy Statement on Allowances for Credit Losses (Revised\nApril 2023).\u201d\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 5 Recent hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural disasters have increased risks concerning insurance and\nresidential real estate collateral administration, including risks from lapses in coverage, collateral coverage\nsufficiency, nonstandard coverage related to perils, riders, and exclusions, and blanket bond insurance\nsufficiency in recovering uninsured losses. Affordability pressures in some geographies, notably increases\nin taxes and insurance premiums (including significant increases in premiums for flood and homeowners\u2019\ninsurance), are more material and may adversely affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay debts.\nB. MARKET RISK\nMarket and liquidity risk are stable. NIMs5 improved in the second half of 2024 (as shown in figure 1) as\nbanks were able to pass on lower rates to depositors due to EFFR reductions and improved funding mix.\nAsset-based liquidity6 and deposits in OCC-supervised banks were fairly stable in 2024. Deposit competition\nand deposit assumptions warrant continued monitoring through liquidity and interest rate stress testing\nand modeling. Unrealized investment portfolio losses remain a concern and heighten the importance of\nbanks\u2019 access to operationally ready contingent funding sources. Inflation uncertainty and impact of EFFR\nmovement heighten the importance of robust IRR scenario analysis and assumption sensitivity testing.\nFIGURE 1: OCC-SUPERVISED BANKS QUARTERLY NIM TREND\nAssets < $1 Billion Assets > $1 Billion All banks\n5 NIM in this \u201cMarket Risk\u201d section refers to a trend of the ratio identified in the Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR).\nThe calculation is quarterly annualized NII divided by average earning assets.

The NIM ratio is calculated\nas quarterly annualized net interest income (NII) divided by average earning assets. NIMs for all banks have improved by 6 basis\npoints when comparing the first quarter of 2024 to the fourth quarter of 2024. Banks with assets greater than $1 billion reported a 17-basis-point decline in earning asset yields in the\nfourth quarter, while margins improved due to a 21-basis-point decline in funding costs as banks began to\nbenefit from the 100-basis point reduction in the federal funds target rate that started in September 2024.\nFunding costs in the fourth quarter also benefited from less reliance on brokered deposits and borrowings.\nElevated unrealized losses in investment portfolios remain a concern. Fluctuations in the yield on\n10-year U.S. Treasury securities (UST) resulted in large quarter-to-quarter changes in unrealized losses,\nparticularly in held-to-maturity (HTM) securities. The 10-year UST market yield declined to 3.81 percent\nas of September 30, 2024 (as shown in figure 2), and unrealized losses in HTM securities fell to two-year\nlows of 10.4 percent and 6.5 percent in banks with assets greater than $1 billion and banks with assets less\nthan $1 billion, respectively (as shown in figure 3). The 10-year UST market yield subsequently moved\nback up to 4.58 percent by year-end 2024 (as shown in figure 2) and unrealized losses rose above\nyear-end 2023 levels.\nFIGURE 2: 10-YEAR UST MARKET YIELD, JANUARY 2024 TO FEBRUARY 2025\nMarket Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis\n5.0%\n4.5\n4.58% (December 31)\n4.0\n3.81% (September 30)\n3.5\nJan Mar May July Sept Nov Jan\n\u201824 \u201824 \u201824 \u201824 \u201824 \u201824 \u201825\nSource: Federal Reserve, retrieved from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) system, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nNote: This chart represents the market yield on UST at 10-year constant maturity.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 7 FIGURE 3: QUARTERLY TRENDS OF HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENT GAINS\/\nLOSSES AS A PERCENT OF AMORTIZED COST\nAssets > $1 Billion\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 8\nseitiruceS\nMTH\n\/)tsoC\ndezitromA-VF(\ntsoC\ndezitromA\n2021 2022 2023 2024\n0.00%\n-5.00%\n-10.00%\n-15.00%\nQ4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\nAssets < $1 Billion\nQ4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\nseitiruceS\nMTH\n\/)tsoC\ndezitromA-VF(\ntsoC\ndezitromA\n2021 2022 2023 2024\n0.00%\n-5.00%\n-10.00%\nSource: OCC\u2019s Integrated Banking Information System (IBIS)\nNote: This chart represents the entire federal banking system bifurcated by asset size of $1 billion.

Unrealized losses in banks with\nassets greater than $1 billion declined from 5 percent at year-end 2023 to 4 percent at year-end 2024 despite\nvolatility and the large fourth-quarter increase in the 10-year UST yield. Unrealized AFS portfolio losses\nin banks with less than $1 billion in assets rose back to year-end 2023 levels of approximately 9 percent\ndespite the 10-year UST yield being 70 basis points higher than one year prior. Exposure to unrealized\nlosses in investment portfolios continues to underscore the importance of operational readiness to access\nalternative funding sources. Banks can use liquidity stress testing as part of contingency planning to help\nidentify model reliability and access investment portfolio liquidity without exposing earnings and capital to\nrealized losses.\nUncertainty surrounds the direction and magnitude of inflation and what, if any, effect this may have on\nthe direction and impact of Federal Open Market Committee decisions on the federal funds target rate. This\nuncertainty continues to heighten the importance of a robust suite of IRR stress testing scenarios in both\nrising and falling rate environments as well as assumption sensitivity testing. Scenarios involving yield\ncurve flattening and inversion may also be effective to consider in light of recent history. C. OPERATIONAL RISK\nCYBERSECURITY\nOperational risk remains elevated as cyber threat actors continue to target banks and their service providers.\nSimultaneously, banks continue to increasingly rely on third parties, including fintech firms, expanding the\ncyberattack surface. The risks posed by the increasing reliance on a few third parties, in certain instances,\nincreases the likelihood of a single point of failure. A single point of failure due to an operational disruption\nor cyberattack could trigger widespread and cascading effects across the financial sector.\nThe OCC continues to observe cyber threat actors targeting banks of all sizes with ransomware attacks,\nemphasizing the importance of operational resilience, including testing business continuity and incident\nresponse plans. Cyber threat actors are also increasing their use of \u201cdouble extortion attacks.\u201d7 This\ntactic pressures the bank into paying a ransom8 even if it can restore impacted systems and data from\nunaffected backups.\nThe United States Secret Service alerted financial institutions to an increase in automated teller machine\n(ATM) jackpotting, or ATM cashout, attempts in 2024. Criminals, sometimes disguised as service\ntechnicians, access and alter the ATM\u2019s security controls to illegally dispense cash. Jackpotting can\ninvolve using a universal ATM key to open the ATM units, install malware to the ATM\u2019s system, connect\nthe ATM to an unauthorized external device (black box), or install an unauthorized device between the\nATM\u2019s computer and network cable connection. Examples of controls that may be relevant to mitigating\nrisks related to ATM jackpotting attempts include cybersecurity and technology controls, such as installing\nsoftware updates and patches in a timely manner, and physical security controls, such as security cameras,\nalarms, changing universal keys, and ongoing monitoring of ATM activity.\nOPERATIONAL RESILIENCE\nBanks are exposed to a wide range of potential disruptive events, including technology-based failures, cyber\nincidents, pandemic outbreaks, and natural disasters. While advances in technology have improved banks\u2019\nability to identify and recover from various types of disruptions, cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated\nand interdependencies with counterparties and service providers are growing. These operational risks\nhighlight the importance for banks to ensure continued maintenance of effective operational resilience.\n7 In a double extortion attack, cyber threat actors gain access to and encrypt a bank\u2019s sensitive information and threaten to\nleak the exfiltrated data if the bank fails to pay a ransom.\n8 The U.S. government has strongly discouraged banks from paying ransom or extortion demands, as there is no guarantee\ndata will be unencrypted or not destroyed, and payment of the ransom may increase the likelihood of repeated extortion\nattempts. Ransom payments benefit illicit actors, can undermine the national security of the United States, and may\npotentially violate the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions.

Incorporating new\nproducts and services can assist with marketplace competition, lower consumer costs, and enhance customer\nexperience. While adoption of new technologies and novel business arrangements with third parties to\ndeliver products and services to end users can offer benefits to banks and their customers, these activities\nmay add additional complexity to the operating environment, impacting banks\u2019 governance, change\nmanagement, and risk management needs depending onto the bank\u2019s size, complexity, and risk profile.9\nBanks have approached artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI (genAI), adoption cautiously,\nbut overall, global adoption continues to increase, with banks, businesses, and governments exploring\nvarious use cases. Responsible AI use can help banks make more informed decisions, enhance efficiency,\nand provide better and more customized services to households and businesses of all sizes. AI in banking\ncurrently includes real-time fraud and anomaly detection and prevention; some components of credit\nunderwriting, such as financial analysis and collateral evaluation processes; document reading and\ninformation extraction; and personalized customer recommendations. Banks continue to explore the use of\ngenAI and implement use cases. AI may also be helpful for regulatory compliance management, enterprise\nrisk management, and data analysis. While beneficial, using any form of AI, whether produced internally or\nby a third party, can introduce model, cybersecurity, and compliance risks.\nThe OCC is attentive to ongoing developments regarding digital assets in the federal banking system.10\nOn March 7, 2025, the OCC issued Interpretive Letter (IL) 118311 rescinding IL 1179. IL 1183 reaffirms\nthat the crypto-asset custody, distributed ledger, and stablecoin activities discussed in prior letters are\npermissible. On May 7, 2025, the OCC issued IL 1184,12 providing further clarification on bank\u2019s authority\nregarding crypto-asset custody services. As with all novel banking activities, the OCC expects banks\nengaging in crypto-asset activities to do so in a safe, sound, and fair manner; consistent with effective risk\nmanagement practices; in alignment with the bank\u2019s overall prudent business plans; and in compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations.\n9 Refer to OCC Bulletin 2017-43, \u201cNew, Modified, or Expanded Bank Products and Services: Risk Management Principles\u201d\nand OCC Bulletin 2023-17, \u201cThird-Party Relationships: Interagency Guidance on Risk Management.\u201d A bank must comply\nwith applicable laws and regulations, including ensuring an activity is performed in a safe and sound manner, regardless\nof whether the bank performs the activity internally or through a third party.\n10 Refer to Executive Order \u201cStrengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,\u201d 90 Fed. Reg. 8647\n(January 23, 2025).\n11 IL 1183, \u201cOCC Letter Addressing Certain Crypto-Asset Activities\u201d (March 7, 2025).\n12 IL 1184, \u201cClarification of Bank Authority Regarding Crypto-Asset Custody Services\u201d (May 7, 2025).\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 10 Many banks and service providers face challenges with maintaining legacy technology architectures\nwhile responding to increasing digitalization demands.13 Innovations in payment systems using emerging\ntechnologies, such as distributed ledger technologies and mobile payment platforms, can bypass traditional\nlegacy banking infrastructure and disrupt fee revenue streams that banks rely upon. There is a risk that\nfailure to upgrade systems and digitize may result in loss of market share to competitors offering faster and\ncheaper payment alternatives. Additionally, there is a risk that prolonged use of older or legacy systems could\nincrease the likelihood of operational outages, introduce security vulnerabilities, create system maintenance\nchallenges, and create other concerns that could reduce operational resilience.\nThe board of directors (board) may delegate the bank\u2019s daily managerial duties to others; however, the board\nis ultimately responsible for providing the appropriate oversight to ensure that the bank operates in a safe\nand sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.14 This includes consideration\nof whether new activities are consistent with the bank\u2019s strategic goals and risk appetite and comply with\napplicable laws and regulations. The board is also responsible for ensuring management implements an\neffective risk management system that identifies, measures, monitors, and controls risks related to new\nactivities. This includes management informing the board and the board understanding any material risks that\nmay impact earnings and capital.15\nFRAUD RISK MANAGEMENT\nFraud affects numerous stakeholders, including banks and their customers. The interconnected payments\necosystem highlights the importance of information sharing and collaboration. Banks can support their\ncustomers by providing information about fraud trends and ways to protect themselves.16 Customer\neducation can help consumers be aware of fraud schemes and trends. Ongoing training can help bank staff\nto identify red flags and respond to customers seeking to conduct transactions outside their usual transaction\npatterns. Bank trade groups may be able to facilitate sharing of information at a level that could help reduce\nor mitigate risks in the banking system.\nCriminals continue to exploit traditional payment methods. Fraud schemes commonly target checks, wire\ntransfers, peer-to-peer payment platforms, and insiders. While fraud schemes are constantly evolving, social\nengineering, phishing, account takeover, business email compromise, impersonation (e.g., of business\nexecutives, government officials, third parties, or tech support), romance and investment scams, and identity\ntheft schemes remain lucrative.\n13 The OCC recently released a request for information on community banks\u2019 engagement with digitalization. Refer to OCC\nBulletin 2025-8, \u201cBank Activities: Request for Information on Community Bank Digitalization.\u201d\n14 Refer to OCC Bulletin 2017-43, \u201cNew, Modified, or Expanded Bank Products and Services: Risk Management Principles,\u201d\nand the \u201cCorporate and Risk Governance\u201d booklet of the Comptrollers Handbook.\n15 Id.\n16 See OCC Bulletin 2019-37, \u201cOperational Risk: Fraud Risk Management Principles.\u201d\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 11 First-party fraud (or friendly fraud) occurs when an external party, including a bank customer, uses their\nown identity to commit fraud against the bank. Card holders may attempt to take advantage of chargeback\nrules to dispute a legitimate charge on their card. Foundational controls, such as customer authentication and\ncontinuous monitoring of account transaction activity using historical data and technology tools, may help\nbanks to identify higher-risk accounts and prevent fraud.\nInsider abuse can expose banks to excessive risk and cause a loss of customer confidence. The digital\nenvironment presents opportunities for employees to manipulate information to misappropriate assets,\ncommit financial statement fraud, steal information to resell, or conduct other illicit activity. Mobile phones\nand other electronic devices facilitate the capture and theft of sensitive customer information, especially\nwhen permitted in sensitive areas of the bank. Required step-aways, such as mandatory vacation and job\nrotation, can limit a single employee\u2019s control over a specific task.\nD. COMPLIANCE RISK\nBANK SECRECY ACT\/ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND\nOFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC)\nElevated levels of fraud, including traditional fraud schemes and use of innovative technology to perpetrate\nfraud, may result in increased volumes of suspicious activity alerts and increased SAR filing obligations.\nIn some cases, banks are leveraging BSA staff to help manage related risks in other areas of the bank, e.g.,\nfraud investigations, which could affect continuity of BSA operations.\nAs banks continue to implement innovative technologies, including partnering with fintechs to deliver new\nor expanded products and services, the fintechs may not always have appropriate experience, technical\nexpertise, and resources in place. This could undermine their ability to effectively manage these associated\nrisks, particularly regarding a bank\u2019s BSA\/AML or sanctions risk profile, which may be altered by changing\nbusiness models or global events.\nThe Treasury Department in March 2025 issued an interim final rule that removes the requirement for\nU.S. companies and U.S. persons to report beneficial ownership information to the Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network (FinCEN) under the Corporate Transparency Act.17 OCC-supervised banks must\ncontinue to comply with the existing FinCEN 2016 Customer Due Diligence rule18 and other existing\nBSA requirements. There are currently no specific requirements for banks to incorporate the National\n17 FinCEN, News Release, \u201cFinCEN Removes Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements for U.S. Companies and U.S.\nPersons, Sets New Deadlines for Foreign Companies\u201d (March 21, 2025).\n18 Customer Due Diligence Requirements for Financial Institutions, 81 Fed. Reg. 29398 (May 11, 2016).\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 12 Priorities issued by FinCEN into their risk based BSA compliance programs until the effective date of\nfinal revised regulations.\nCONSUMER COMPLIANCE\nCompliance risk increases when banks do not promptly investigate, resolve, and, as appropriate, credit\nfunds in accordance with applicable laws, such as the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E), the\nExpedited Funds Availability Act (Regulation CC), and the Federal Trade Commission Act. As discussed\nabove, increased levels and sophistication of fraud may necessitate reasonable delays as allowed by law or\nregulation. However, this may also exacerbate compliance risk when banks take prolonged timeframes to\ncomplete investigations or implement broad account access limitations, preventing customers, including\nthose who are not victims of fraud, from accessing their funds.19\nAs interest rates fluctuate, banks may offer new or updated deposit products, such as high-yield savings\naccounts or a greater variety of certificates of deposit (CD). Compliance risk may increase when\ncommunications on CD rollover processes or maturity options lack clarity or cause confusion, for example,\nwhen rates paid on rolled-over CDs are far below the original promotional rates offered by a bank. Compliance\nrisk may rise as insurance premiums rise. For example, failure to maintain adequate flood insurance coverage\ncan lead to violations of the Flood Disaster Protection Act and its implementing regulations.\n19 For example, limited check deposit availability exceptions under Regulation CC require additional compliance obligations.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 13 PART II\nECO N OM I C O P E R AT I N G\nE N V I RO N M E N T\nGLOBAL ECONOMIC OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\nEconomic analysts generally forecast slow global economic growth for 2025. However, there remains\nuncertainty stemming from trade policies as well as geopolitical tensions in Europe, the South China Sea,\nand the Middle East. Economic growth remains tepid in Europe, with Germany facing challenges restoring\nindustrial competitiveness and the risk of higher tariffs undermining business confidence. Prolonged\nindustrial overcapacity and weak domestic demand in China have further increased China\u2019s reliance on\nexports to support growth, creating trade imbalances that are worsening global trade tensions. Uncertainty\nsurrounding trade policies and tariffs, a strong U.S. dollar, and high geopolitical risk are all expected to\ncreate a challenging environment for emerging market countries. However, India may be an exception, with\nstrong GDP growth projected for 2025, as it positions itself as a manufacturing alternative to China.\nAsynchronous monetary policy decisions by central banks could result in exchange rate and bond market\nvolatility. In Europe, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England are lowering interest rates, as\ninflation appears reasonably contained while growth is very weak, whereas in the U.S. the Federal Reserve\nis expected to keep rates level in the first half of 2025. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan is increasing policy\nrates as inflation is unusually above target. Many emerging markets have policy rates at relatively high\nlevels due to elevated and persistent inflation, with some countries such as Brazil seeing large policy rate\nincreases. These differing paths for monetary policy across key countries create an environment where\n\u201ccarry trades\u201d could be suddenly reversed and unwound, transmitting exchange rate and interest rate\nvolatility across global financial markets, similar to the Japanese yen carry trade unwind in August 2024.\nHigh debt and debt servicing costs are a key risk for many countries and corporate entities. This risk is\nnot restricted to emerging market countries. Many advanced economies, such as France and the U.K., are\nstruggling to lower budget deficits as they grapple with very high debt levels and weak growth. Fiscal\nconcerns in Europe are compounded by pressure to increase defense spending. There is a risk of countries\nexperiencing higher rates of inflation and lower bond prices as the stock of outstanding bonds accumulates.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 14 DOMESTIC ECONOMIC OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\nCONSUMPTION BOOSTED ECONOMIC\nGROWTH IN 2024\nDespite heightened uncertainty, the economy remains in a solid position. After the brief pandemic-era\nrecession in the second quarter of 2020, U.S. real GDP has grown solidly and, by the first quarter of 2025,\nwas 12 percent above its pre-pandemic peak in the fourth quarter of 2019. This translates to 2.3 percent\ngrowth per quarter at an annual rate, slightly above the economy\u2019s long-term potential trajectory of\n2.0 percent growth.20 The labor market has also displayed strength during the same time period. Payroll\nemployment in April 2025 was 5.5 million21 above its pre-pandemic peak while unemployment remains\nnear historical lows, at 4.2 percent.22\nThe economy reached a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2024, though growth slowed towards the end of the\nfourth quarter, and the U.S. economy shrank 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2025. Some slowing of\nactivity was evident toward the end of 2024, with the annualized growth rate at 2.5 percent in the fourth\nquarter. Consumer spending and residential investment supported economic momentum throughout 2024,\nand they reached annualized growth rates of 4.0 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, in the fourth quarter.\nBut this was offset by weakness elsewhere. Businesses spent far less on restocking inventories in the fourth\nquarter of 2024 and pulled back on investment in structures and equipment, resulting in slower overall\ngrowth. At the same time, job creation continued at pre-pandemic levels, with 177,000 jobs created in April\n2025. Most economists remain cautious in their near-term assessments as the outlook for the economy has\ngrown more uncertain. Some forecasters note that consumers appear poised to slow spending as households\ndepleted much of their excess savings built up during the pandemic, wage growth continues to slow, and\njob gains have eased since the close of last year. Moreover, consumer confidence has declined sharply\naccording to both the Conference Board and University of Michigan indexes. Business confidence has also\ndecreased, with expectations for investment spending falling across all five of the Federal Reserve\u2019s most\nrecent regional manufacturing surveys. The Consensus predicts that growth in real private nonresidential\nfixed investment will slow from 3.6 percent for all of last year to 1.2 percent in 2025, and slow further to\n0.8 percent in 2026.\nGiven these trends, the Consensus expects real GDP growth to moderate to 1.0 percent at an annual rate\nby the third quarter of 2025 and then increase slightly in the following quarters. The Consensus expects\n20 Congressional Budget Office estimate of potential growth.\n21 Civilian Employment, seasonally adjusted, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 2025.\n22 The Employment Situation, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 2005-2025.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 15 full-year growth to be 1.2 percent in 2025 and 1.3 percent 2026 (as shown in figure 4).

By the fourth quarter of 2026, PCE inflation is projected to fall to 2.2 percent, only\nslightly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target.\nFIGURE 4: REAL GDP, ANNUAL PERCENT CHANGE\n7%\n6\nRecessions\n5\n4\n2.8%\n3\n2\n1.2% 1.3%\n1\n0\nBlue Chip\n-1 Consensus\nForecast\n-2\n-3\n-4\n'07 '08 '09 '10 '11 '12 '13 '14 '15 '16 '17 '18 '19 '20 '21 '22 '23 '24 '25 '26\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis (4Q:2024), Blue Chip Economic Indicators (May 2025)\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 16 PART III\nB A N K P E R FO R M A N C E\nBANK PROFITABILITY REMAINED RESILIENT\nIN 2024, AMID SLOWER LOAN GROWTH\nProfitability in the federal banking system was stable in 2024, with return on equity at 11.7 percent,\ncompared with 11.5 percent a year prior. For banks with less than $10 billion in total assets, profitability\ndeclined slightly from a year ago, from 10.7 percent to 10.4 percent, but remained at a solid level compared\nwith historical averages (as shown in figure 5). Though the Federal Reserve started to ease monetary policy\nin the latter half of 2024, interest rates remained relatively high throughout the year, leading to subdued\nloan growth and compression of NIM. For 2025, the earnings outlook will depend on how banks navigate\nan uncertain economic climate and the future path of interest rates. The federal banking system remains\nresilient and well-positioned to absorb stress, with capital ratios and liquidity high by historical standards.\nThe federal banking system\u2019s ratio of liquid assets to total assets was at 31 percent in 2024, compared with\n16 percent in 2008.\nFIGURE 5: TREND IN BANK RETURN ON EQUITY\n20%\nRecessions\n15\nFederal Banking System\n10\nAssets < $10B\n5\n0\n-5\n'84 '86 '88 '90 '92 '94 '96 '98 '00 '02 '04 '06 '08 '10 '12 '14 '16 '18 '20 '22 '24\nSource: Call reports from OCC Integrated Banking Information System\nNote: Data are annual values 1984-2024. Banks with less than $10 billion in total assets exclude credit card and trust institutions.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 17 NII growth, a key driver of bank profitability, slowed in 2024, in part due to higher funding costs and lower\nloan growth. For the federal banking system, NII was largely unchanged, with a slight 0.3 percent decline,\nwhile banks with assets less than $10 billion saw a 2.7 percent growth. For both the federal banking system\nand banks with assets less than $10 billion, higher noninterest income offset some of the weakness in NII\nand supported revenue, while growth in expenses was modest. In addition, the federal banking system\nbenefited from gains in the equity securities portfolio in 2024, which also supported profitability. Overall,\nthis led to an improvement in net income for the federal banking system and banks with assets less than\n$10 billion, increasing 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively (as shown in table 1).\nTABLE 1: TRENDS IN BANK NET INCOME (IN $BILLIONS)\nBanks with total assets\nFederal Banking System\n<$10 billion\n2023 2024 Y\/Y % change 2023 2024 Y\/Y % change\nYear-to-date revenues in billions of dollars\nNet interest\n461.8 460.6 -0.3% 24.0 24.6 2.7%\nincome\nNoninterest\n213.1 223.5 4.9% 8.3 8.8 6.6%\nincome\nYear-to-date expenses in billions of dollars\nProvisioning 61.9 66.1 6.7% 1.3 1.3 5.1%\nNoninterest\n397.0 396.5 -0.1% 20.9 21.8 4.3%\nexpense\nNet income 169.7 179.4 5.7% 7.8 8.3 6.4%\nSource: Call reports from OCC Integrated Banking Information System\nNote: Data are merger-adjusted and held constant for banks in continuous operation from the first quarter of 2020 to the fourth\nquarter of 2024. Banks with less than $10 billion in total assets exclude credit card and trust institutions.\nBank funding costs increased in 2024, as interest rates remained elevated and depositors continued to switch\ninto higher-yielding accounts. While the increase in funding costs was more pronounced among banks with\nassets less than $10 billion, those banks also realized greater gains on asset yields compared with the overall\nsystem, resulting in smaller NIM compression. Banks with assets less than $10 billion were slower to\nreprice deposits in response to the cuts in the federal funds rate that began in September, compared with the\noverall system. Both the federal banking system and banks with assets less than $10 billion, however, have\nrepriced deposits faster than in the last interest rate cutting cycle in 2019.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 18 Recent changes in banks\u2019 balance sheets have positioned banks to potentially benefit more from a decline\nin interest rates relative to prior periods when the Federal Reserve lowered rates. For example, a higher\nproportion of banks carry more short-term liabilities relative to short-term assets compared with the\nbeginning of 2019, the start of the previous rate-lowering cycle.23 Though a number of factors can affect\nhow changes in interest rates impact NIM, this suggests that a greater share of banks could benefit from\nlower deposit rates compared with prior periods.\nLoan growth remained weak in 2024, at 1.6 percent (as shown in figure 6). Weak growth was primarily\ndriven by a decline in C&I and nonfarm nonresidential real estate loans. Loan growth was supported by\nincreases in credit card balances and loans to nondepository financial institutions (NDFI). Real estate\nloans drove a 4 percent increase in loan balances at banks with assets less than $10 billion in total assets.\nResidential real estate, nonfarm nonresidential, and multifamily lending account for more than 60 percent\nof community bank lending.\nFederal banking system deposits grew at the same pace as loans, 1.6 percent, following deposit outflows in\n2022 and 2023. The loan-to-deposit ratio, one measure of liquidity, remained below the pre-pandemic level\nfor the federal banking system. For banks with assets less than $10 billion, with slightly faster loan growth,\nloan-to-deposit ratios have nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nFIGURE 6: YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN LOAN BALANCES FOR\nTHE FEDERAL BANKING SYSTEM, PERCENT\n2023 2024\n25% 22.5\n20\n15 12.9\n10.7\n10 8.1\n6.5\n5.1\n5\n0.4 1.6 1.1 0.7\n0\n-1.9 -2.0 -0.8 -1.2\n-5 -3.9 -3.0 -4.3 -3.7-4.5\n-10\n-15 -12.3\nTotal loans Residential Credit Other Nonfarm Multi- Construction C&I NDFI Remainder\nRE cards consumer nonres RE family\n2024\nshare of\ntotal loans 23% 12% 7% 9% 4% 2% 20% 9% 12%\nSource: Call reports from OCC Integrated Banking Information System\nNote: Data are merger-adjusted and held constant from banks in continuous operation from the first quarter of 2020 to the fourth\nquarter of 2024. \u201cOther consumer\u201d is consumer loans less credit card loans. \u201cRemainder\u201d includes agricultural loans and loans to\ngovernments and municipalities.\n23 56 percent of banks have positive net short-term liabilities (measured as liabilities of one year or less minus assets one\nyear or less, as a share of total assets) compared with 41 percent of banks at the beginning of 2019.\nSEMIANNUAL RISK PERSPECTIVE SPRING 2025 19 Net charge-off rates slightly increased from the prior year but remained historically strong.

As of March 31, 2025, the bank reported approximately $77 million in total assets. The OCC acted after finding the bank had experienced substantial dissipation of assets and earnings due to unsafe or unsound practices. The OCC also found the bank was in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business and that the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assets were less than its obligations to its creditors and others. The FDIC will release information about the resolution of the bank. Media ContactCarrie Moore (202) 649-6870 Topic(s): Branches & Offices",

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-61 | June 27, 2025 Acting Comptroller of the Currency Issues Statement on Order Granting Exemption to Customer Identification Program Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood issued the following statement today in support of the Order granting an exemption to the Customer Identification Program (CIP) rule to benefit both consumers and the banking industry. I support the Order granting an exemption to the Customer Identification Program, or CIP rule, allowing banks to utilize an alternative collection method to obtain Taxpayer Identification Number information from a third party, rather than from a customer, provided that certain other criteria are met. The Order is a good step in the process of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) modernization. It will benefit both consumers and the banking industry by promoting innovation and financial inclusion and providing banks more flexibility to operate in a manner that suits their business model. The Order promotes an innovative approach to CIP compliance by supporting greater use and acceptance of online or mobile banking activities and allowing banks to leverage the use of online identity verification services that were neither available nor contemplated by regulators when this rule was adopted in 2003. The Order also promotes financial inclusion, allowing greater access to financial products and services by addressing the legitimate concerns of customers who are unwilling to provide their full TIN in an electronic format, in an online account opening or credit application. Importantly, this Order does not impose any new requirements, but instead has the potential to ease regulatory burden by allowing banks the choice to adopt new, innovative methods of CIP compliance, if the bank deems them to be beneficial for its business model. I want to stress that the changes allowed by the Order provide these benefits without compromising the ability of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BSA regime to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crime. Finally, I would like to thank the staff at the federal financial institution regulatory agencies and our colleagues at FinCEN for their hard work and collaboration on this matter.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-60 | June 27, 2025 Agencies Issue Exemption Order to Customer Identification Program Requirements Share This Page: Joint Release Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Financial Crimes Enforcement Network National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration (collectively, \u00e2\u0080\u009cagencies\u00e2\u0080\u009d), with the concurrence of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, today issued an order granting an exemption from a requirement of the Customer Identification Program (CIP) Rule implementing Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act. The CIP Rule requires a bank or credit union to obtain taxpayer identification number (TIN) information from its customer before opening an account, and the exemption permits a bank or credit union to use an alternative collection method to obtain TIN information from a third-party rather than from the customer. The order applies to accounts at all entities supervised by the agencies. Since the CIP Rule was issued initially in 2003, there has been a significant evolution in the ways consumers access financial services, along with a rise in reported customer reluctance to provide their full TIN due, in part, to data breaches and identity theft concerns. Accordingly, this exemption provides flexibility to those entities supervised by the agencies that must comply with the CIP Rule. The exemption does not change the underlying requirement for banks and credit unions to have risk-based CIP procedures that enable them to form a reasonable belief they know the true identity of each customer. This exemption is optional, and entities are not required to use an alternative collection method to obtain a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TIN information.

This ORDER does not apply to banks not subject to the jurisdiction of the Agencies. The term \u201cbank\u201d is\ndefined in regulations implementing the BSA, 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.100(d), and includes each agent, agency, branch, or\noffice within the United States of banks, savings associations, credit unions, and foreign banks.\n4 See 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.220(a)(2)(i)(A)(4); see also 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.100(yy). A TIN is defined by section 6109 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6109) and the Internal Revenue Service regulations implementing\nthat section (e.g., Social Security Number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), or employer\nidentification number (EIN)).\n5 Under the CIP Rule, a TIN is the required identification number for a customer that is a U.S. person and one of the\npossible identification numbers for a customer that is a non-U.S. person.\n6 The terms account and customer are defined at 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.100(a) and (b), respectively.\n7 See, e.g., 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5.34(e)(3) and 5.38(e)(3) (requirements governing operating subsidiaries of national banks\nand Federal savings associations); see also Agencies, FinCEN, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(Federal Reserve), Office of Thrift Supervision, Department of the Treasury, Interagency Interpretive Guidance on\nCustomer Identification Program Requirements under Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act (Apr. 28, 2005),\navailable at https:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/resources\/statutes-regulations\/guidance\/interagency-interpretive-guidance-\ncustomer-identification (for interagency FAQs describing the applicability of the CIP Rule to bank subsidiaries).\n1 that the bank otherwise complies with the CIP Rule, which requires written procedures that: (1)\nenable the bank to obtain TIN information prior to opening an account; (2) are based on the\nbank\u2019s assessment of the relevant risks; and (3) are risk-based for the purpose of verifying the\nidentity of each customer to the extent reasonable and practicable, enabling the bank to form a\nreasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer. The use of this exemption by\nbanks is optional; banks are not required to use an alternative collection method for TIN\ninformation.\nBackground\nFinCEN and the Agencies recognize that considerable changes in the way that customers interact\nwith banks and receive financial services have occurred since 2001, when section 326 of the\nUSA PATRIOT Act was enacted into law. The importance of collecting TIN information from\nthe customer rather than through another method for identification and verification purposes has\nlessened since regulations implementing section 326 were adopted in 2003, particularly in light\nof the availability of new methods that a bank can use alongside TIN information to form a\nreasonable belief that the bank knows the true identity of each customer. As a result, in March\n2024, FinCEN, in consultation with staff at the Agencies, issued a CIP Request for Information\n(the \u201cCIP RFI\u201d) that sought information from the public to understand the potential risks and\nbenefits, as well as safeguards that could be established, if banks were permitted to obtain part or\nall of a customer\u2019s TIN information from a third-party source prior to opening an account rather\nthan from the customer.8 FinCEN and the Agencies considered comments received through the\nCIP RFI, as well as the significant innovation in identity verification tools available to banks and\nother factors as described below, in granting this exemption from one aspect of the CIP TIN\ncollection requirements.\nRegulatory Requirements\nThe legislative framework generally referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which consists\nof the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, as amended by the USA\nPATRIOT Act and other legislation, including the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, is\ndesigned to combat money laundering (ML), the financing of terrorism (TF), and other illicit\nfinance activity.9 One of the main purposes of the BSA enumerated by Congress is to prevent\nthe laundering of money and the financing of terrorism by requiring financial institutions to\nestablish reasonably designed, risk-based programs to combat such risks.10 To fulfill the\npurposes of the BSA, Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to\nadminister the BSA, and the Secretary has delegated the authority to implement, administer, and\nenforce compliance with the BSA and its implementing regulations to the Director of FinCEN.11\n8 FinCEN, Request for Information and Comment on Customer Identification Program Rule Taxpayer Identification\nNumber Collection Requirement, 89 FR 22231 (Mar. 29, 2024).\n9 USA PATRIOT Act, Public Law 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (2001).

The procedures must specify the customer identifying\ninformation that a bank will obtain from each customer prior to opening an account, including, at\na minimum, the customer\u2019s name, date of birth (for an individual), address, and identification\nnumber, which is a TIN for U.S. persons.16 Generally, to fulfill the CIP Rule\u2019s identification\nnumber requirement, a bank must obtain TIN information from the customer, except with respect\nto credit card accounts.17\nThe CIP Rule also requires that a bank\u2019s CIP contain procedures to verify customer identity\nthrough documentary methods, non-documentary methods, or a combination of both, within a\n12 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318(l)(2).\n13 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318(l)(3).\n14 See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318(l)(4).\n15 See, e.g., the Agencies, FinCEN, Federal Reserve, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, Customer Identification\nPrograms for Banks, Savings Associations, Credit Unions and Certain Non-Federally Regulated Banks, 68 FR\n25090, 25103 (May 9, 2003) (codified at 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.220). Additionally, in 2020, FinCEN issued a final rule\nimplementing the CIP Rule for banks that lack a Federal functional regulator. See FinCEN, Customer Identification\nPrograms, Anti-Money Laundering Programs, and Beneficial Ownership Requirements for Banks Lacking a Federal\nFunctional Regulator, 85 FR 57129 (Nov. 16, 2020) (codified at 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010 and 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020).\n16 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.220(a)(2)(i). For non-U.S. person customers, the required identification number may include, in\naddition to a TIN, a passport number and country of issuance, alien identification card number, or number and\ncountry of issuance of any other government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a\nphotograph or similar safeguard. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.220(a)(2)(i)(B). A bank\u2019s CIP may include procedures for\nopening an account for a customer that has applied for but has not received a TIN. In this case, the CIP must include\nprocedures to confirm that the application was filed before the customer opens the account and to obtain the TIN\nwithin a reasonable period of time after the account is opened. This ORDER applies only to TIN information.\n17 Regarding credit card accounts, the CIP Rule allows banks to obtain customer identification information from a\nthird-party source prior to extending credit to the customer. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.220(a)(2)(i)(C).\n3 reasonable time after the account is opened. Verification methods include checking government-\nissued identification documents (documentary means) or the comparison of information provided\nby the customer with information obtained from a consumer reporting agency, public database,\nor other source; checking references with other financial institutions; and obtaining a financial\nstatement (non-documentary means).18\nThe BSA provides the Secretary and the appropriate Agency with the authority to, by regulation\nor order, exempt any financial institution or type of account from the requirements of any\nregulation prescribed under section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act.19 Under implementing\nregulation 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.220(b), the appropriate Agency, with the concurrence of FinCEN,\nmay by order or regulation exempt any bank or type of account from the requirements of the CIP\nRule. The CIP Rule requires FinCEN and the Agencies to consider whether the exemption is\nconsistent with the purposes of the BSA and with safe and sound banking and permits\nconsideration of other appropriate factors.20\nFindings Supporting an Exemption\nSince the CIP Rule was issued in 2003, FinCEN and the Agencies have observed a significant\nexpansion in ways that consumers access financial services, along with a rise in reported\ncustomer reluctance to provide their full TIN due, in part, to data breaches and identity theft\nconcerns. In recent years, FinCEN and the Agencies have received continued public interest\nthrough letters and comments from banks, trade associations, and Members of Congress in\npermitting alternative collection methods for products and services beyond credit card\naccounts.21 In the CIP RFI, FinCEN acknowledged there are, and will be, other available\ncustomer identifying attributes that banks may obtain, some of which vary in accuracy and\nauthenticity, that could be used holistically as part of a bank\u2019s risk-based verification procedures\nunder the CIP Rule.\nThe comments submitted in response to the CIP RFI provided insight into the benefits of third-\nparty source TIN collection as well as potential risks. FinCEN received comments from a\nvariety of stakeholders\u2014banks and bank trade associations, financial technology companies,\ncommunity organizations, third-party organizations, and individuals. Those in support of\nalternative collection methods commonly referenced the success of the credit card exception and\ninnovation in customer verification methods. Those opposed, among other concerns, suggested\nthat alternative collection methods would increase costs on financial institutions that do not\nalready use third-party verification services. They stated that, in lieu of obtaining TIN\ninformation from the customer, these institutions would instead need to direct limited resources\ntowards third-party identity verification services for TIN retrieval. Several commenters\nquestioned the reliability of third-party sources, with one bank trade association cautioning that\n18 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.220(a)(2)(ii).\n19 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318(l)(5).\n20 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.220(b).\n21 See, e.g., Ranking Member Congresswoman Maxine Waters of the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services\nletter to FinCEN and the Agencies (Sept. 7, 2023), available at https:\/\/democrats-financialservices.house.gov\/news\/\ndocumentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=410778.\n4 the intended purpose of these types of vendors was not true fraud prevention or customer\nverification.\nIn arriving at their findings, FinCEN and the Agencies considered letters and comments received;\nFinCEN\u2019s technical analysis of BSA information; FinCEN\u2019s consultation with law enforcement\nagencies; and the Agencies\u2019 examinations of current CIP programs and procedures (which may\nhave included such processes for credit card accounts at banks with appropriate oversight,\npolicies, procedures, and identity verification tools). Based on the analysis of this information,\nFinCEN has not identified heightened ML\/TF or other illicit finance risk solely relating to the\nmethod of collection of TINs, and the Agencies consider an alternative collection method for\nTIN information consistent with safe and sound banking. FinCEN and the Agencies therefore\nfind there is a valid basis for an exemption to allow banks the option to use an alternative\ncollection method for TIN information.\nEvidence from the Credit Card Exception Supports Expansion to Other Types of Accounts\nFor over 20 years, the CIP Rule has allowed banks to obtain the identifying information required\nby the CIP Rule from a third-party source when a customer is opening a credit card account. For\nthese accounts, the bank may obtain the identifying information about a customer, including a\nTIN, from a third-party source prior to extending credit to the customer. FinCEN and the\nAgencies recognized at the time that without this exception, the CIP Rule would alter a bank\u2019s\nbusiness practices by requiring additional information beyond what was already obtained directly\nfrom a customer who opened a credit card account at the point of sale or by telephone.22\nCommenters raised concerns during the CIP Rule comment period that customers applying for\ncredit card accounts were reluctant to give out their complete TIN, especially through non-face-\nto-face means, due to consumer privacy and security concerns.23 In the CIP Rule, FinCEN and\nthe Agencies further acknowledged that imposing a direct collection requirement on banks that\noffer credit card accounts would likely alter the manner in which they do business by requiring\nthem to gather additional information beyond that which they currently obtain directly from a\ncustomer who opens an account at the point of sale or by telephone. FinCEN and the Agencies\nreferenced the legislative history of section 326, which indicated that Congress expected the\nregulations implementing this section to be appropriately tailored for accounts opened in\nsituations where the account holder is not physically present at the financial institution and that\nthe regulations should not impose requirements that are burdensome, prohibitively expensive, or\nimpractical.24\nTherefore, FinCEN and the Agencies included an exception in the final CIP Rule for credit card\naccounts only that allowed a bank broader latitude to obtain some information from the customer\nopening a credit card account and the remaining information from a third-party source, such as a\n22 Agencies, FinCEN, Federal Reserve, Office of Thrift Supervision, Customer Identification Programs for Banks,\nSavings Associations, Credit Unions and Certain Non-Federally Regulated Banks, 68 FR 25090, 25103 (May 9,\n2003) (codified at 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020.220).\n23 Id. at 25098.\n24 House Committee on Financial Services, Report on the Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, H.R. Rep. No. 107-\n250, pt. 1, at 63 (2001).\n5 credit reporting agency, prior to extending credit to a customer. In the CIP Rule, FinCEN and the\nAgencies recognized this practice as an efficient and effective means of extending credit with\nlittle risk that the lender did not know the identity of the borrower.25 Similar to credit card\naccounts, it is now common practice for banks to offer other types of products and services\nthrough non-face-to-face means, such as via a mobile app or website. For example, Forbes\u2019 2022\nDigital Banking Survey found that 78 percent of adults preferred banking over the internet rather\nthan in person.26 Additionally, customers are obtaining financial services using non-bank\nfinancial institutions at a significant rate. The FDIC\u2019s National Survey of Unbanked and\nUnderbanked Households found that in 2023, half of all households (49.7 percent) were using\nnon-bank online payment services, up from 46.4 percent in 2021.27\nIn light of these changes that have led to an increase in account openings using non-face-to-face\nmeans, FinCEN and the Agencies believe that the rationale relating to consumer privacy and\nsecurity concerns provided for the credit card exception in 2003 as well as concerns about\nrequirements being burdensome, prohibitively expensive, or impractical is applicable to all other\ntypes of accounts that are now easily accessible to customers through non-face-to-face means.\nSince the adoption of the credit card exception as part of the CIP Rule, FinCEN has not\nidentified heightened ML\/TF or other illicit finance risks associated specifically with the\nalternative collection method used by banks when opening credit card accounts where such\nmethods are appropriately managed.\nConsumer Privacy and Security Concerns Regarding TIN Collection\nThe letters and comments received by FinCEN and the Agencies assert that there is an elevated\nrisk of identity theft and data breaches occurring when the full TIN is obtained from the\ncustomer through non-face-to-face means. In addition, BSA filings indicate that perpetrators of\nfraud, including check fraud, often opened their accounts online with fraudulent or stolen\nidentification information,28 which could argue for the need for banks to have more rigorous,\nrather than less, information collection from the customer when accounts are opened through\nnon-face-to-face means in order for banks to form a reasonable belief that they know the true\nidentity of the person opening the account. However, FinCEN\u2019s analysis of BSA filings does not\nsuggest that the risk of fraud was related to the method for obtaining customer information by a\nbank, whether from the customer or from a third party. Additionally, the American Bankers\nAssociation Banking Journal reported in 2023 that the SSN was the second most exposed\nindividual credential after name.29 During the first quarter of 2024, TransUnion reported that\n25 68 FR at 25097.\n26 Forbes Advisor, Consumer Banking Trends and Statistics (Jan. 21, 2024), available at\nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/banking-trends-and-statistics\/.\n27 FDIC, National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households (2023), available at\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/household-survey\/2023-fdic-national-survey-unbanked-and-underbanked-households-report.\n28 FinCEN, Financial Trend Analysis, Mail Theft-Related Check Fraud: Threat Pattern & Trend Information,\nFebruary to August 2023 (Sept. 2024), available at https:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/shared\/FTA-Check-\nFraud-FINAL508.pdf.\n29 American Bankers Association Banking Journal, Report: Synthetic identity fraud on rise (Aug. 24, 2023),\navailable at https:\/\/bankingjournal.aba.com\/2023\/08\/report-synthetic-identity-fraud-on-rise\/.\n6 data breach risks rose significantly due to the high level of SSN exposures.30 These statistics\nunderscore the consumer hesitancy to provide the consumer\u2019s TIN through non-face-to-face\nmeans, and through this exemption, FinCEN and the Agencies will allow banks the means to\nobtain the customer\u2019s TIN through alternative collection methods.\nReliable Alternatives Exist for Verification Today that Did Not Exist or Were Not as Prevalent\nTwenty Years Ago\nReliable alternative processes for verification\u2014which allow the bank to form a reasonable belief\nthat it knows the true identity of each customer\u2014are more prevalent today than when the CIP\nRule was issued, meaning there could be circumstances in which such processes produce an\nequivalent or more reliable outcome when banks are permitted the flexibility to change their\nmethod of TIN collection based on the bank\u2019s assessment of the relevant risks. The combination\nof the increase in vulnerability of TINs to identity theft and the availability of reliable alternative\noptions for verification lessens the importance of the specific method of TIN collection for\nidentity verification.\nWhile FinCEN and the Agencies are not prescribing specific alternative processes for banks,\nsuch processes should take into consideration the purpose of the CIP Rule\u2014to ensure a bank is\nable to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer\u2014and the bank\u2019s\nassessment of the relevant risks, including those presented by the various types of accounts\nmaintained by the bank, the various methods of opening accounts provided by the bank, the\nvarious types of identifying information available, and the bank\u2019s size, location, product and\nservice offerings, and customer base.\nPotential Risks of Alternative TIN Collection Methods\nFinCEN received comments in response to the CIP RFI that raised concerns about increased risk\nwhen TIN information is not obtained from the customer. A commenter noted that the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) issued guidance in 2020 that it considers a SSN masked when only the\nlast four digits are visible, which the commenter noted raises concerns that the last four SSN\ndigits may be more readily compromised than the full TIN.31 Similarly, one state bank\nassociation said their members stated it is easier for a fraudster to guess the last four digits of a\nconsumer\u2019s SSN than provide all nine digits accurately. A bank trade association raised that the\nSSN continued to be a strong customer identifier in comparison to the other identifying pieces of\ninformation a customer can provide. Individuals may undergo changes to their address, email, or\nphone number, but they rarely change their SSN.\nWith regard to potential increased fraud risk through alternative collection methods, FinCEN and\nthe Agencies believe this is addressed because a bank\u2019s use of an alternative collection method\n30 See, e.g., CUToday, Severity of Data Breach Risks Hit Highest Level in Two Years During Q1, TransUnion\nReports (May 28, 2024), available at https:\/\/www.cutoday.info\/Fresh-Today\/Severity-of-Data-Breach-Risks-Hit-\nHighest-Level-in-Two-Years-During-Q1-TransUnion-Reports.\n31 IRS, What are we doing to protect taxpayer privacy? (Feb. 7, 2025), available at https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/privacy-\ndisclosure\/what-are-we-doing-to-protect-taxpayer-\nprivacy#:~:text=A%20masked%20SSN%20is%20an,*%2D**%2D1234.\n7 must otherwise comply with the CIP Rule, which requires written procedures that: (1) enable the\nbank to obtain TIN information prior to opening an account; (2) are based on the bank\u2019s\nassessment of the relevant risks; and (3) are risk-based for the purpose of verifying the identity of\neach customer to the extent reasonable and practicable, enabling the bank to form a reasonable\nbelief that it knows the true identity of each customer Further, these procedures (including use of\nan alternative collection method) must be based on the bank\u2019s assessment of the relevant risks,\nincluding those presented by the various types of accounts maintained by the bank, the various\nmethods of opening accounts provided by the bank, the various types of identifying information\navailable, and the bank\u2019s size, location, and customer base.\nSeveral commenters raised concerns that community banks and credit unions may not have the\nresources to implement the third-party TIN retrieval and verification service needed for an\nalternative TIN collection method and that implementing such a service could increase\noperational costs associated with account opening, which could negatively impact the unbanked.\nTherefore, smaller banks would be at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger banks.\nFinCEN and the Agencies emphasize there is no requirement to use this exemptive relief, and if a\nbank chooses to continue obtaining the full TIN from the customer, they may do so.\nSome commenters raised issues that could occur if a bank only had the last four digits of a TIN.\nFor example, some commenters stated that many people have the same last four digits. One\nstated that out of 119 people, there is a 50 percent chance that two will have the same last four;\nof 180 people, there is an 80 percent chance; and out of 300 people, there is more than 99 percent\nchance. The commenters stated this commonality could give rise to possible unintended\nconsequences. For example, one commenter said it would be more complicated to create a\n\u201cblacklist\u201d for previously identified bad actors or place limitations on the number of accounts if\nonly the last four digits are used. In addition, one entity stated this could increase concern for\ncustomers with common names or those using the same name (e.g., Jr., Sr., III). FinCEN and the\nAgencies reiterate that if an alternative collection method is used, the bank must still obtain the\nfull TIN from a third-party source prior to opening an account, and the TIN is one piece of\ncustomer identifying information among others that the bank must obtain and use to verify the\ncustomer\u2019s identity.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons described below, FinCEN and the Agencies find there is a valid basis for an\nexemption from the requirement to obtain TIN information from the customer for all accounts at\nall banks subject to the jurisdiction of the Agencies in the circumstances discussed herein. If\nbanks use an alternative collection method when obtaining TIN information about a customer,\nthey must otherwise comply with the CIP Rule, which requires written procedures that: (1)\nenable the bank to obtain TIN information prior to opening an account; (2) are based on the\nbank\u2019s assessment of the relevant risks; and (3) are risk-based for the purpose of verifying the\nidentity of each customer to the extent reasonable and practicable, enabling the bank to form a\nreasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer.\n8 First, FinCEN finds this exemption, when used appropriately, is consistent with the purposes of\nthe BSA. Banks must include an alternative collection method for TIN information in their\nexisting, reasonably designed, risk-based, and written CIP procedures that combat ML\/TF and\nother illicit finance activity. This exemption is also consistent with the factors discussed in the\nstatute, including \u201cthe various types of accounts maintained by various types of financial\ninstitutions, the various methods of opening accounts, and the various types of identifying\ninformation available.\u201d32 Furthermore, through an analysis of BSA reporting, FinCEN has not\nidentified a heightened ML\/TF or other illicit finance risk associated with the alternative\ncollection method for TIN information process used by banks when opening credit card\naccounts.\nSecond, the Agencies find this exemption, when used appropriately, would be consistent with\nsafe and sound banking. The resulting banking practices will not be contrary to generally\naccepted standards of prudent banking operation and will not give rise to abnormal risk of loss or\ndamage to an institution or its shareholders. This exemption does not change the overall purpose\nof the existing, general CIP requirement for each bank to have CIP procedures that enable the\nbank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer.\nTherefore, FinCEN and the Agencies hereby grant by ORDER an exemption from a requirement\nof the CIP Rule implementing section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318(l) in the\ncircumstances discussed herein. Specifically, this Order provides an exemption from the CIP\nRule that permits a bank to use an alternative collection method to obtain TIN information from\na third-party rather than from the customer, provided that the bank otherwise complies with the\nCIP Rule, which requires written procedures that: (1) enable the bank to obtain TIN information\nprior to opening an account; (2) are based on the bank\u2019s assessment of the relevant risks; and (3)\nare risk-based for the purpose of verifying the identity of each customer to the extent reasonable\nand practicable, enabling the bank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of\neach customer.\nNothing in this ORDER shall bar, estop, or otherwise prevent the Agencies from taking any\naction affecting a bank, including the revocation of this ORDER, if a bank uses an alternative\nmethod for TIN collection but is not able to demonstrate its ability to form a reasonable belief\nthat it knows the true identity of each customer.\nBanks taking advantage of this exemption must continue to comply with all other regulatory\nrequirements pursuant to the BSA.\n32 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318(l)(3). These factors are mentioned in the statute in the context of what the Secretary should take\ninto consideration when prescribing regulations.\n9 IT IS SO ORDERED, this 27th day of June, 2025\nOFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY\nBy: ____\/s\/_________________________________\nJay Gallagher\nSenior Deputy Comptroller for the Office of the Chief National Bank Examiner\nFEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION\nBy: ____\/s\/________________________________\nRyan Billingsley\nActing Director, Division of Risk Management Supervision\nNATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION\nBy: ____\/s\/________________________________\nAmanda Parkhill\nActing Director, Office of Examination and Insurance\nWITH CONCURRENCE, this 27th day of June, 2025\nOF THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK\nBy: ____\/s\/________________________________\nAndrea M.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-59 | June 27, 2025 Agencies Request Comment on Proposal to Modify Certain Regulatory Capital Standards Share This Page: Joint Release Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Reserve Board Office of the Comptroller of the Currency The federal bank regulatory agencies today requested comment on a proposal to modify certain regulatory capital standards to reduce disincentives for banking organizations to engage in lower-risk activities and promote the smooth functioning of U.S. Treasury markets. Banking organizations are subject to both risk-based and leverage capital requirements. Risk-based capital requirements vary based on the risks of individual exposures, imposing lower capital requirements, for example, on a Treasury security with lower risk than on a corporate bond with higher risk. Leverage capital requirements, by design, treat all exposures equally. A leverage capital requirement that is generally higher than risk-based capital requirements can discourage banking organizations from engaging in low-risk activities, such as U.S. Treasury market intermediation. The proposal would modify certain leverage capital standards applicable to the largest and most systemically important banking organizations so that they serve as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements and do not discourage these banking organizations from engaging in low-risk activities. In particular, the proposal would set the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for both bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries so that it is based on a banking organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall systemic risk. The agencies anticipate that the amount of overall capital that banking organizations maintain would generally stay the same as a result of this proposal. In aggregate, the proposal would reduce tier 1 capital standards for affected bank holding companies by less than two percent. Although certain depository institution subsidiaries could see greater reductions, that capital generally would not be available for distribution to external shareholders given the restrictions that apply at the bank holding company level. The proposal would also make conforming changes to other regulations that are tied to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, such as total loss-absorbing capacity and long-term debt requirements. Comments on the proposal are due by August 26, 2025.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-58 | June 25, 2025 Agencies Release List of Distressed or Underserved Nonmetropolitan Middle-Income Geographies Share This Page: Joint Release Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Reserve Board Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Federal bank regulatory agencies today released the 2025 list of distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where certain bank activities are eligible for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit. Under the CRA, the agencies assess a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The list released by the agencies includes distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where revitalization or stabilization activities are eligible to receive CRA consideration. The designations reflect local economic conditions, including unemployment, poverty, and population changes. Previous years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lists and criteria for designating these areas are available here. Revitalization or stabilization activities in these geographies are eligible to receive CRA consideration under the community development definition for 12 months after publication of the current list. As with past lists, the agencies apply a one-year lag period for geographies that were included in 2024 but are no longer designated as distressed or underserved in the current list. The agencies leveraged an updated methodology to designate underserved middle-income census tracts for this list, based upon revised source information from various agencies. As a result, the amended urban influence codes use similar criteria and methods as previous delineations but have been consolidated from 12 to 9 categories. Additional information is available in the Source Information and Methodology.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-57 | June 25, 2025 Acting Comptroller of the Currency Issues Statement on Proposal to Modify the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood issued the following statement today following his approval of an interagency notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio: I strongly support the notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the leverage ratio standard applicable to the largest and most systemically important banking organizations. The proposal would better tailor our capital requirements for banks to ensure the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio functions as a true backstop\u00e2\u0080\u0094not a primary constraint that limits lending unnecessarily. The proposal aligns with my commitment that the capital framework should support resilience but does not constrain growth. The proposal would reduce tier 1 capital for depository institution subsidiaries of global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs) to allow for more efficient allocation of capital throughout a banking organization, while ensuring that the amount of overall capital that banking organizations maintain would not materially change. Overall, the proposal would provide the largest and most systemically important banking organizations significant flexibility and capacity to engage in low-risk, low-return activities. Additionally, the proposal is expected to support increased lending and economic activity. This increased competition in lending and capital markets could lead to more favorable terms for consumers and businesses. The proposal would rely on a GSIB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk profile to set the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for both the bank holding company and its depository institution subsidiary. The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GSIB surcharge framework takes into consideration the size, complexity, and interconnectedness of the banking organization as a whole. Using the GSIB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk profile would provide tailoring of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard. Instead of a one-size-fits all add-on, the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard would range from 3.5 percent to 4.25 percent depending on a banking organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk profile. This would be lower than the current 5 percent standard at the holding company and 6 percent standard at the depository institution. Additionally, for covered depository institutions, the proposal would modify the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio to be a buffer standard instead of the well-capitalized threshold under the prompt corrective action framework. This will provide flexibility to covered depository institutions as the buffer will serve as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cearly warning\u00e2\u0080\u009d threshold instead of triggering automatic limitations under the prompt corrective action framework. In addition, a buffer approach may have less pro-cyclical effects because a banking organization may choose to use its buffer during times of economic stress, which could lessen the likelihood that the banking organization would reduce lending and other activities during such times. This proposal will not only reduce burden but will also help promote the smooth functioning of U.S. Treasury markets. The proposed modifications would help ensure that the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards generally serve as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements rather than as a regularly binding constraint. I support the issuance of the NPR and encourage all stakeholders to submit comments on the proposal. We will carefully review and consider all comments. Additionally, I will continue to look for appropriate opportunities to calibrate regulatory requirements to be effective, not excessive, while ensuring the safety, soundness and fairness of the federal banking system.

In addition to the OCC\u2019s supervisory activities, the agency works with other financial\nsupervisors and major market participants to address infrastructure, clearing, and margining\nissues in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.\nThis is the 118th edition of the OCC\u2019s Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives\nActivities. The first report was published in 1995. Please send any comments or feedback on the\nstructure and content of this report to QuarterlyDerivatives@occ.treas.gov.\nExecutive Summary\n\u2022 Insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations (collectively, banks) reported\ntrading revenue of $15.0 billion in the first quarter of 2025, $408 million less (2.7 percent)\nthan in the previous quarter and $297 million less (1.9 percent) than a year earlier (see\ntable 1).\n\u2022 Initial credit exposure from derivatives before netting decreased in the first quarter of 2025\ncompared with the fourth quarter of 2024.

Since the 2008 financial crisis and the adoption\nof bank holding company charters by the former investment banks, the percentage of bank\ntrading revenue to consolidated BHC trading revenue has generally declined, resulting in a\nmedian of 45 percent over the past 17 years. This decline reflects the significant amount of\ntrading activity by the former investment banks that, while included in BHC results, remains\noutside insured commercial banks. More generally, insured U.S. commercial banks and savings\nassociations have more limited legal authorities than their holding companies, particularly in the\ntrading of commodity and equity products.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, banks generated 48.2 percent of consolidated holding company\ntrading revenue, a decrease from 77.2 percent in the previous quarter (see figure 1).\nFigure 1: Bank Trading Revenue as a Percentage of Consolidated Holding Company Trading Revenue\nSource: Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies\u2014FR Y-9C (Schedule HI) and call report (Schedule RI)\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nCounterparty credit risk is a significant risk in bank derivative trading activities. The notional\namount of a derivative contract is a reference amount that determines contractual payments, but\nit is generally not the amount at risk. The credit risk in a derivative contract is a function of\nseveral variables, such as whether counterparties exchange notional principal, the volatility of the\nunderlying market factors (interest rate, currency, commodity, equity, or corporate reference\nentity), the maturity and liquidity of the contract, and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.\nCredit risk in derivatives differs from credit risk in loans because of the more uncertain nature of\nthe potential credit exposure. Because the credit exposure is a function of movements in market\nfactors, banks do not know\u2014and can only estimate\u2014how much the value of the derivative\ncontract might be at various points in the future.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: First Quarter 2025 3 The credit exposure is bilateral in most derivative transactions, such as swaps (which make up\nthe bulk of bank derivative contracts). Each party to the contract may (and, if the contract has a\nlong enough tenor, probably will) have a credit exposure to the other party at various times\nduring the contract\u2019s life. With a funded traditional loan, the amount at risk is the amount\nadvanced to the borrower. The credit risk is unilateral as the bank faces the credit exposure of the\nborrower.\nMeasuring credit exposure in derivative contracts involves identifying those contracts a bank\nwould lose value on if the counterparty to a contract defaulted. The total of all contracts with\npositive value (i.e., derivative receivables) to the bank is the gross positive fair value (GPFV)\nand represents an initial measurement of credit exposure. The total of all contracts with negative\nvalue (i.e., derivative payables) to the bank is the gross negative fair value (GNFV) and\nrepresents a measurement of the exposure the bank poses to its counterparties.\nGPFV decreased by $237 billion (9.9 percent) in the first quarter of 2025 to $2.2 trillion, driven\nby a $288.0 billion (34.9 percent) decrease in receivables from FX contracts (see table 3a).\nGNFV decreased $222.0 billion (9.7 percent) to $2.1 trillion during the quarter, driven by a\n$268.0 billion (33.5 percent) decrease in payables from FX contracts (see table 3b).\nTable 3a: Gross Positive Fair Values, in Billions of Dollars\nQ\/Q Q\/Q % Y\/Y Y\/Y %\nTrading instruments 1Q 2025 4Q 2024 Change Change 1Q 2024 Change Change\nInterest rate $1,316 $1,301 $16 1.2% $1,318 \u2013$2 \u20130.1%\nFX $539 $828 \u2013$288 \u201334.9% $516 $23 4.5%\nEquity $193 $176 $17 9.5% $183 $10 5.5%\nCommodity and other $57 $40 $17 43.0% $47 $10 22.4%\nCredit $45 $43 $2 4.1% $39 $6 14.7%\nGPFV $2,150 $2,387 \u2013$237 \u20139.9% $2,103 $48 2.3%\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-L\nTable 3b: Gross Negative Fair Values, in Billions of Dollars\nQ\/Q Q\/Q % Y\/Y Y\/Y %\nTrading instruments 1Q 2025 4Q 2024 Change Change 1Q 2024 Change Change\nInterest rate $1,245 $1,227 $17 1.4% $1,255 \u2013$10 \u20130.8%\nFX $532 $800 \u2013$268 \u201333.5% $504 $27 5.4%\nEquity $207 $195 $11 5.8% $201 $6 2.7%\nCommodity & other $49 $36 $13 34.9% $45 $4 8.5%\nCredit $50 $46 $5 9.8% $43 $7 16.8%\nGNFV $2,082 $2,305 \u2013$222 \u20139.7% $2,048 $34 1.7%\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-L\nNote: Numbers may not add up to total due to rounding.\nA legally enforceable netting agreement between a bank and a counterparty creates a single legal\nobligation for all transactions (called a \u201cnetting set\u201d) under the agreement. Therefore, when\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: First Quarter 2025 4 banks have such agreements with their counterparties, contracts with negative values (an amount\na bank would pay to its counterparty) can offset contracts with positive values (an amount the\ncounterparty owes the bank), leaving an NCCE as shown in table 4.\nTable 4: Netting Contract Examples\nNumber of Value of\nBank A portfolio with counterparty B contracts contracts Credit measure\/metric\nContracts with positive value to Bank A 6 $500 GPFV\nContracts with negative value to Bank A 4 \u2013$350 GNFV\nTotal contracts 10 $150 NCCE to Bank A from Counterparty B\nMost derivative transactions that a bank has with an individual counterparty are subject to a\nlegally enforceable netting agreement. Some transactions may be subject to the laws of a\njurisdiction that does not provide legal certainty of netting agreements, in which case banks must\nregard such transactions as separate from the netting set. Other transactions may involve\nnonstandard contractual documentation. Transactions that are not subject to the same legally\nenforceable netting agreement have distinct values that cannot be netted and for which the\nappropriate current credit measure is the gross exposure to the bank if that amount is positive.\nWhile banks can net exposures within a netting set under the same netting agreement, they\ncannot net exposures across netting sets without a separate legally enforceable netting\nagreement. As a result, a bank\u2019s NCCE to a particular counterparty equals the sum of the GPFV\nof contracts less the dollar amount of netting benefits with that counterparty. A bank\u2019s NCCE\nacross all counterparties equals the sum of its NCCE to each of its counterparties.\nNCCE is the primary metric the OCC uses to evaluate credit risk in bank derivative activities.\nNCCE for insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations decreased by $21.3 billion\n(7.9 percent) to $249 billion in the first quarter of 2025 (see table 5).3 Legally enforceable\nnetting agreements allowed banks to reduce GPFV exposures by 88.4 percent ($1.9 trillion) in\nthe first quarter of 2025.

Neither measure comprehensively captures NCCE.\nRC-L includes exposure only from OTC derivative transactions; it excludes exchange-traded transactions. RC-R\nexcludes transactions not subject to capital requirements. This report uses RC-R to measure NCCE.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: First Quarter 2025 5 NCCE peaked at $804.0 billion at the end of 2008 during the financial crisis when interest rates\nhad plunged and credit spreads were very high (see figure 2). The decline in NCCE since 2008\nhas largely resulted from declines in the GPFV of interest rate and credit contracts. After a large\nincrease in NCCE during the first quarter of 2020 as markets responded to the financial impact of\nthe COVID-19 global pandemic, NCCE ended the first quarter of 2025 at $254.0 billion\nexhibiting more typical market activity.\nFigure 2: Net Current Credit Exposure, in Billions of Dollars\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-R\nThe bulk of NCCE in the financial system is concentrated in banks and securities firms (35.1\npercent) and in corporations and other counterparties (58.2 percent) (see table 6).

Banks use value-at-risk (VaR) to quantify the maximum expected loss over a specified\ntime and at a certain confidence level under relevant market conditions. Banks subject to the\nmarket risk capital rule, 12 CFR 3, subpart F, are required to report their VaR-based measures\nquarterly on Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Form 102. The VaR\nmeasurement is calculated daily using a one-tail, 99 percent confidence level and a holding\nperiod equivalent to a 10-business-day movement in underlying risk factors, such as rates,\nspreads, and prices. Tables 9a and 9b show the quarter-over-quarter change in VaR, as well as\nthe VaR-based capital charge, for banks most active in trading and derivatives activity. As shown\nin table 9a, market risk in trading operations, as measured by VaR, is a small proportion of their\nrisk-based capital. Figure 21 in the appendix illustrates the historical trend in VaR measurements\nfor these institutions.\nTable 9a: Value-at-Risk, in Millions of Dollars\nJPMorgan Goldman\nChase Bank Bank of Sachs Bank\nValue-at-risk NA Citibank NA America NA USA\n1Q 2025 average 60-day VaR $279 $202 $83 $263\n4Q 2024 average 60-day VaR $246 $189 $78 $333\nQ\/Q change $33 $14 $6 \u2013$71\n1Q 2025 total risk-based capital $298,442 $168,066 $209,624 $68,793\nSource: Market Risk Regulatory Report for Institutions Subject to the Market Risk Capital Rule\u2014FFIEC 102\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: First Quarter 2025 8 Table 9b: Value-at-Risk Capital Requirement, in Millions of Dollars\nJPMorgan Goldman\nChase Bank Bank of Sachs Bank\nValue-at-risk capital requirement NA Citibank NA America NA USA\n1Q 2025 VaR capital requirement $838 $607 $250 $788\n4Q 2024 VaR capital requirement $738 $566 $234 $1,000\nQ\/Q change $100 $42 $17 \u2013$213\n1Q 2025 total risk-based capital $298,442 $168,066 $209,624 $68,793\nSource: Market Risk Regulatory Report for Institutions Subject to the Market Risk Capital Rule\u2014FFIEC 102\nVolatility Index\nFigure 3 shows the VIX, a volatility index,5 which measures the market\u2019s expectation of stock\nmarket volatility in the S&P 500 index over the next 30-day period.

The figure shows that an extended\nperiod of low volatility following the end of the 2008 financial crisis continued until late in the\nfirst quarter of 2020. In mid-March 2020, volatility spiked and exceeded its previous high from\nthe 2008 financial crisis as financial markets reacted to fears over the potential impact of the\nCOVID-19 global pandemic. While the volatility index experienced its largest one-day spike on\nAugust 25, 2024, because of an asymmetric widening of bid-ask spreads and corresponding\nincrease in option price quotes, the VIX has settled back to a more typical level of 21.7 percent at\nthe end of the first quarter of 2025.\nFigure 3: Volatility Index (VIX)\nSource: Bloomberg\n5 VIX is the trademarked ticker symbol for the Chicago Board Options Exchange SPX Volatility Index.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: First Quarter 2025 9 Level 3 Trading Assets\nAnother measure used to assess market risk is the volume of and changes in level 3 trading\nassets. Level 3 trading assets are assets whose fair value cannot be determined by using\nobservable inputs, such as market prices. Since the peak of the financial crisis at the end of 2008,\nmajor dealers have reduced the volume of level 3 trading assets. Because the model inputs that\ndetermine the fair value of these exposures are not derived from observable market transactions,\nbanks use their own model assumptions in determining their fair values. Level 3 trading assets\npeaked at $204.0 billion at the end of 2008 (see figure 4). At the end of the first quarter of 2025,\nbanks held $34 billion of level 3 trading assets, down 1.4 percent from the previous quarter and\n8.2 percent lower than a year ago.

This arrangement\nmeans that a bank\u2019s receivables or payables, in the event of the default or insolvency of one of\nthe parties, would be the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of contracts included in\nthe bilateral netting arrangement.\nCentrally cleared derivative contract: A standardized derivative contract that is transacted\nbilaterally but submitted for clearing to a central counterparty, with the central counterparty\nbecoming the ultimate counterparty to both the buyer and the seller.\nCredit derivative: A financial contract that allows a party to take on or reduce credit exposure\n(generally on a bond, loan, or index). The OCC\u2019s derivatives survey includes OTC credit\nderivatives, such as credit default swaps, total return swaps, and credit spread options.\nDerivative: A financial contract in which the value is derived from the performance of\nunderlying market factors, such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity,\ncredit, and equity prices. Derivative transactions include a wide assortment of financial contracts,\nsuch as structured debt obligations and deposits, swaps, futures, options, caps, floors, collars,\nforwards, and various combinations thereof.\nGross negative fair value (GNFV): The sum total of the fair values of contracts when the bank\nowes money to its counterparties, without taking netting into account. This amount represents the\nmaximum losses the bank\u2019s counterparties would incur if the bank defaulted and there was no\nnetting of contracts, and the counterparties held no bank collateral. GNFVs associated with credit\nderivatives are included.\nGross positive fair value (GPFV): The sum total of the fair values of contracts when the bank\nis owed money by its counterparties, without taking netting into account. This amount represents\nthe maximum losses a bank would incur if all its counterparties defaulted and there was no\nnetting of contracts, and the bank held no counterparty collateral. GPFVs associated with credit\nderivatives are included.\nNet current credit exposure (NCCE): For a portfolio of derivative contracts, NCCE is the\nGPFV of contracts less the dollar amount of netting benefits. On any individual contract, current\ncredit exposure (CCE) is the fair value of the contract if positive and zero when the fair value is\nnegative or zero. NCCE is also the net amount owed to banks if all contracts were immediately\nliquidated.\nNotional amount: The nominal or face amount that is used to calculate payments made on\nswaps and other risk management products. This amount generally does not change hands and is\nthus referred to as notional.\nOTC derivative contracts: Privately negotiated derivative contracts that are transacted off\norganized exchanges.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: First Quarter 2025 14 Potential future exposure (PFE): An estimate of what the CCE could be over time, based on a\nsupervisory formula in the agencies\u2019 risk-based capital rules. PFE is generally determined by\nmultiplying the notional amount of the contract by a credit conversion factor that is based on the\nunderlying market factor (e.g., interest rates, commodity prices, or equity prices) and the\ncontract\u2019s remaining maturity. The risk-based capital rules, however, permit banks to adjust the\nformulaic PFE measure by the net-to-gross ratio, which proxies the risk-reduction benefits\nattributable to a valid bilateral netting contract. PFE data in this report use the amounts on which\nbanks hold risk-based capital.\nQualifying central counterparties (QCCP): QCCPs are defined in 12 CFR 3.2 as a CCP either\nthat the Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated systemically important under title\nVIII of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or that meets a series\nof standards. See 12 CFR 3.2 for a full definition.\nTotal credit exposure: The sum total of NCCE and PFE.\nTotal risk-based capital: The sum of tier 1 plus tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital generally consists\nof common shareholders\u2019 equity, perpetual preferred shareholders\u2019 equity with noncumulative\ndividends, retained earnings, and tier 1 capital of consolidated subsidiaries that is not owned by\nthe bank (minority interest), less regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 2 capital generally\nconsists of subordinated debt, intermediate-term preferred stock, cumulative and long-term\npreferred stock, tier 2 capital of consolidated subsidiaries that is not owned by the bank (minority\ninterest), and a portion of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses less regulatory\nadjustments and deductions.\nVolatility index (VIX): A measure of the market\u2019s expectation of stock market volatility of\nS&P 500 index options over the next 30-day period.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: First Quarter 2025 15 Appendix: Index of Tables and Figures\nTables\nTable 1: Quarterly Bank Trading Revenue, in Millions of Dollars .................................................2\nTable 2: Quarterly Holding Company Trading Revenue, in Millions of Dollars ............................2\nTable 3a: Gross Positive Fair Values, in Billions of Dollars ...........................................................4\nTable 3b: Gross Negative Fair Values, in Billions of Dollars .........................................................4\nTable 4: Netting Contract Examples ................................................................................................5\nTable 5: Net Current Credit Exposure, in Billions of Dollars .........................................................5\nTable 6: Net Current Credit Exposure by Counterparty Type as a Percentage of\nTotal Net Current Credit Exposure ............................................................................................6\nTable 7: Ratio of Fair Value Collateral to Net Current Credit Exposure ........................................7\nTable 8: Composition of Collateral..................................................................................................8\nTable 9a: Value-at-Risk, in Millions of Dollars ..............................................................................8\nTable 9b: Value-at-Risk Capital Requirement, in Millions of Dollars ............................................9\nTable 10: Derivative Notional Amounts by Underlying Risk Exposure\nQuarter-Over-Quarter, in Billions of Dollars ...........................................................................11\nTable 11: Derivative Notional Amounts by Contract Type\nQuarter-Over-Quarter, in Billions of Dollars ...........................

The\ncharacteristics of the loans included here may differ from the overall population. The loans\nincluded are not a statistically representative, random sample.\n\u2022 This report covers the performance of first-lien home mortgages in the portfolios of reporting\nbanks. It excludes junior liens, home equity lines of credit (HELOC), and home equity\nconversion mortgages (reverse mortgages).\n\u2022 For loans with forbearance activity covered by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\nSecurity (CARES) Act, reporting banks are following guidance from the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the respective\ngovernment agencies and government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) for the calculation and\nreporting of delinquency and credit bureau reporting.\n1 The seven national banks are Bank of America, Citibank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, PNC, U.S. Bank, and Wells\nFargo.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: First Quarter 2025 1 Executive Summary\nOverall Mortgage Portfolio and Performance\n\u2022 As of March 31, 2025, the reporting banks serviced approximately 10.9 million first-lien\nresidential mortgage loans with $2.7 trillion in unpaid principal balances (see figures 1 and\n2). This $2.7 trillion was 20.1 percent of all residential mortgage debt outstanding in the\nUnited States.2\n\u2022 Overall mortgage performance this quarter improved from the first quarter of 2024. The\npercentage of mortgages that were current and performing at the end of the first quarter of\n2025 was 97.6 percent compared with 97.4 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2024 (see\nfigure 6). The CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and ended on\nMay 11, 2023, allowed for loan forbearance that could extend up to November 30, 2023, and\nis reflected in the mortgage performance data.\n\u2022 Servicers initiated 10,667 new foreclosures in the first quarter of 2025, an increase from a\nyear earlier (see figure 7). Home forfeiture actions during the first quarter of 2025\u2014\ncompleted foreclosure sales, short sales, and deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure actions\u2014decreased\n8.5 percent from a year earlier to 1,819 (see figure 8).\nNumber and Type of Modifications Completed and Impact on Payment\nAmount\nServicers completed 7,889 modifications during the first quarter of 2025, a 7.6 percent increase\nfrom the previous quarter\u2019s 7,332 modifications.\n\u2022 Of these 7,889 modifications, 7,267, or 92.1 percent, were \u201ccombination modifications\u201d\u2014\nmodifications that included multiple actions affecting the affordability and sustainability of\nthe loan, such as an interest rate reduction and a term extension. Of the remaining 622 loan\nmodifications, 602 received a single action and 20 were not assigned a modification type (see\ntable 1).\n\u2022 Among the 7,267 combination modifications completed during the quarter, 6,173, or\n84.9 percent, included a term extension; 6,017, or 82.8 percent, included capitalization of\ndelinquent interest and fees; 3,467, or 47.7 percent, included an interest rate reduction or\nfreeze; 2,197, or 30.2 percent, included principal deferral; and 2, or less than 0.1 percent,\nincluded principal reduction (see table 2).\n\u2022 Of the 7,889 modifications completed during the quarter, 4,086, or 51.8 percent, reduced the\nloan\u2019s pre-modification monthly payment (see table 3).\n2 Residential mortgage debt is determined using the quarterly Federal Reserve Statistical Release, \u201cZ.1: Financial\nAccounts of the United States,\u201d table L.218, \u201cOne-to-Four-Family Residential Mortgages,\u201d household sector\nliabilities. Data as of March 31, 2025.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: First Quarter 2025 2 Modified Loan Performance\nBy March 31, 2025, all loans modified during the third quarter of 2024 would have aged at least\nsix months. Of the 7,450 modifications completed during the third quarter of 2024, servicers\nreported that 1,880 or 25.2 percent, were 60 or more days past due or in the process of\nforeclosure at the end of the month that the modification became six months old (see table 4).\nFigure 1 shows the outstanding principal balance of reported loans and the change in outstanding\nprincipal balances from the first quarter of 2023 through the first quarter of 2025.\nFigure 1: Total Serviced Mortgage Portfolio\u2014Outstanding Principal in Billions of Dollars\n$2,900\n$2,851\n$2,850\n$2,809\n$2,800 $2,779 $2,769\n$2,739 $2,748 $2,755 $2,744\n$2,750\n$2,712\n$2,700\n$2,650\n$2,600\n$2,550\n$2,500\n$2,450\n$2,400\n1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24 1Q25\nFigure 2 shows the number of first-lien residential mortgages serviced and the change in the\nnumber of loans serviced from the first quarter of 2023 through the first quarter of 2025.\nFigure 2: Total Serviced Mortgage Portfolio\u2014Number of Loans in Thousands\n12,250\n12,008 12,032\n12,000\n11,783\n11,731\n11,750\n11,500\n11,500\n11,279\n11,180\n11,250\n11,072\n11,000 10,862\n10,750\n10,500\n10,250\n10,000\n1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24 1Q25\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: First Quarter 2025 3 Figure 3 shows the number of loans in each risk category and the change in each category from\nthe first quarter of 2023 through the first quarter of 2025.\nFigure 3: Composition\u2014Loans in Thousands by Borrower Risk Category\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n0\n1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24 1Q25\nOther 238 244 239 235 230 224 219 215 211\nSubprime 148 148 145 140 137 134 133 131 127\nAlt-A 198 200 196 192 188 184 181 178 175\nPrime 11,423 11,441 11,203 11,164 10,945 10,737 10,647 10,548 10,348\nFigure 4 reports the percentage of loans in each risk category and shows that the composition of\nloans remained stable since the first quarter of 2023.\nFigure 4: Composition\u2014Percentage of Mortgages by Borrower Risk Category\n2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2%\n100%\n1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1%\n2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2%\n80%\n60%\n95% 95% 95% 95% 95% 95% 95% 95% 95%\n40%\n20%\n0%\n1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24 1Q25\nPrime Alt-A Subprime Other\nFigure 5 shows the number of loans in each category of delinquency from the first quarter of\n2023 through the first quarter of 2025.

For example, these loans may lack high loan-to-value mortgage insurance,\nhave minimal documentation, or be secured by collateral other than the borrower\u2019s primary\nresidence. Alt-A mortgages are based on the borrower\u2019s credit conditions at origination.\nCapitalization: Actions that increase the unpaid principal balance of the loan by the amount of\nany delinquent payments and fees.\nCombination modifications: Modifications that include more than one type of modification\naction. Most modifications generally require changes to more than one term of a loan to bring a\nloan current and reduce monthly payments to an amount that is affordable and sustainable.\nForeclosures in process: Mortgages for which servicers have begun formal foreclosure\nproceedings but have not yet completed the foreclosure process. The foreclosure process varies\nby state. Many foreclosures in process never result in the loss of borrowers\u2019 homes because\nservicers simultaneously pursue other loss mitigation actions, and borrowers may return their\nmortgages to current and performing status.\nInterest rate reductions and freezes: Actions that reduce or freeze the contractual interest rate\nof the loan that was in effect before the modification action.\nLoan modifications: Actions that contractually change the terms of mortgages with respect to\ninterest rates, maturity, principal, or other terms of the loan.\nOther: Mortgages in the portfolio that could not be classified by the bank as Prime, Alt-A, or\nSubprime. Other mortgages are based on the borrower\u2019s credit conditions at origination.\nPrime: Mortgages to borrowers underwritten as part of a conforming or jumbo loan program.\nTypically, these borrowers are eligible for standard loan programs and pricing. For example,\nborrowers typically have mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value exceeds 80 percent of the\ncollateral property value. Prime mortgages are based on the borrower\u2019s credit conditions at\norigination.\nPrincipal deferral modifications: Modifications that remove a portion of the unpaid principal\nfrom the amount used to calculate monthly principal and interest payments for a set period. The\ndeferred amount becomes due at the end of the loan term.\nPrincipal reduction modifications: Modifications that permanently reduce the unpaid principal\nowed on a mortgage.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: First Quarter 2025 11 Re-default: For purposes of this report, a loan is defined as in re-default if it was 60 or more\ndays past due as of the end of the month at which the modification was six months old. For\nexample, a loan that was modified as of November 1, 2023, would be defined as in re-default if it\nwas 60 or more days past due or 30 or more days past due and in the process of foreclosure as of\nits May 31, 2024, reporting date.\nSeriously delinquent loans: Mortgages that are 60 or more days past due and all mortgages held\nby bankrupt borrowers whose payments are 30 or more days past due.\nSubprime: Mortgages to borrowers that display a range of credit risk characteristics that may\ninclude a weak credit history, reduced repayment capacity, or incomplete credit history. A weak\ncredit history may include prior delinquencies, judgments, bankruptcies, or foreclosures on the\ncredit report at the time of underwriting. Subprime mortgages are based on the borrower\u2019s credit\nconditions at origination.\nTerm extensions: Actions that extend the final maturity date of the loan that was in effect before\nthe modification action.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report Method\nLoan delinquencies are reported using the Mortgage Bankers Association convention that a loan\nis past due when a scheduled payment has not been made by the due date of the following\nscheduled payment. The statistics are based on the number of loans, unless stated otherwise.\nPercentages are rounded to one decimal place unless the result is less than 0.1 percent, which is\nrounded to two decimal places. The report uses whole numbers when approximating. Values in\ntables may not total 100 percent because of rounding.\nResults are not seasonally adjusted.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: First Quarter 2025 12",

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-54 | June 18, 2025 OCC Announces Enforcement Actions for June 2025 Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises. The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are: Formal Agreement with Carver Federal Savings Bank, New York, New York, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning and earnings performance. (Docket No. AA-NE-2025-18) Formal Agreement with Sterling Federal Bank, FSB, Sterling, Illinois, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning, capital planning, credit administration, and liquidity risk management. (Docket No. AA-CE-2025-22) Formal Agreement with Texas Heritage National Bank, Daingerfield, Texas, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning, capital planning, liquidity risk management, interest rate risk management, concentration risk management, the allowance for credit losses, and violations of law, rule, or regulation, including those relating to reports of condition and independent audit. (Docket No. AA-SO-2025-32) The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are: Order of Prohibition against William Shane Garrow, former Private Banker at BOKF, N.A., Tulsa, Oklahoma, for misappropriating over $3 million from bank customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accounts for his personal benefit. (Docket No. AA-SO-2025-28) Order of Prohibition against Amilcar A. Sanchez, former Branch Operations Manager and ATM Custodian at a Long Island City, New York, branch of Santander Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for stealing, embezzling, or otherwise misappropriating $370,000 from the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-17) The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d into a new action. Termination actions include: Order Terminating two Graham-Leach-Bliley Act Agreements with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, both dated September 15, 2015 (#2015-105 and #2015-106). The two GLBA Agreements related to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s non-compliance with certain requirements for controlling or holding an interest in financial subsidiaries.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-53 | June 16, 2025 Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Comment to Address Payments and Check Fraud Share This Page: Joint Release Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Reserve Board Office of the Comptroller of the Currency The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced a request for comment on potential actions to help consumers, businesses, and financial institutions mitigate risk of payments fraud, with a particular focus on check fraud. For purposes of the request for information, payments fraud generally refers to the use of illegal means to make or receive payments for personal gain, including scams. Because payments fraud may involve multiple institutions and payment methods, no single agency or private-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. Therefore, the agencies are seeking public comment on discrete actions, collectively or independently, to mitigate payments fraud, including check fraud, within their respective bank regulation and payments authorities. Input is requested on five potential areas for improvement and collaboration: External collaboration among the agencies, Federal Reserve Banks, and industry stakeholders; Consumer, business, and industry education by the agencies and Federal Reserve Banks to educate about payments fraud; Regulation and supervision to mitigate payments fraud, including opportunities the Board may have related to check fraud; Payments fraud data collection and information sharing; and Federal Reserve Banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 operator tools and services to reduce payments fraud. In addition to seeking public input, the agencies will also continue looking for additional opportunities to effectively collaborate across other state and federal agencies given the importance of interagency coordination to help mitigate payments fraud. Comments must be received within 90 days after date of publication in the Federal Register.

Introduction\nPayments fraud inflicts significant harm on consumers, businesses, and financial\ninstitutions. Payments fraud also has the potential to erode public trust in\u2014and\nundermine the safety, accessibility, and efficiency of\u2014the nation\u2019s payments system,\nupon which the U.S. financial system depends. As part of their objectives to promote the\nsafety of the U.S. financial system, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC have overlapping but also\ndiscrete roles and authorities related to the issue of payments fraud. For example, the\nBoard, FDIC, and OCC all engage in supervision of financial institutions. In addition to\nsupervising financial institutions, the FDIC has the distinct mission to maintain stability\nand public confidence in the nation\u2019s financial system as the insurer of bank deposits.\nThe FRS, which includes the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks), also\nfocuses on payment system safety as a payment system operator and catalyst for payment\nsystem improvements. Therefore, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC are each interested in\nexploring ways to help mitigate risk of payments fraud. Given that the FRS, FDIC, and\nOCC have specific differing roles and authorities, this mitigation could take the form of\ncollective action where roles align, such as joint supervisory guidance, or independent\n7 of 22 action where roles differ, such as changes to the payment systems operated by the\nReserve Banks.\nII. Background\nWhile there is no consensus on the definition of \u201cpayments fraud,\u201d for purposes of\nthis RFI, \u201cpayments fraud\u201d generally refers to the use of illegal means, including\nintentional deception, misrepresentation, or manipulation, to make or receive payments\nfor personal gain.1 The term \u201cpayments fraud\u201d also includes scams, a subset of fraud.2\nMany sources indicate that payments fraud is growing. For example, according to\ndata from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), losses reported for noncard payments\nfraud increased 271 percent between 2020 and 2024.3 Data from the U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) show that the number\nof Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed related to check, ACH, and wire fraud have\nincreased 489 percent between 2014 and 2024.4\n1 See U.S. Government Accountability Office, Improper Payments and Fraud: How They Are Related but\nDifferent (Dec. 7, 2023), https:\/\/www.gao.gov\/assets\/d24106608.pdf and U.S. Department of Justice,\nBureau of Justice Statistics, Financial Fraud, https:\/\/bjs.ojp.gov\/taxonomy\/term\/financial-fraud.\n2 See Federal Reserve, FedPayments Improvement, Defined Scams to Fight Scams,\nhttps:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org\/news\/blog\/defined-scams-to-fight-scams.\n3 See FTC Consumer Sentinel Network Fraud Reports, All Fraud Reports by Payment Method,\nhttps:\/\/public.tableau.com\/app\/profile\/federal.trade.commission\/viz\/FraudReports\/FraudFacts (\u201cPayment\n& Contact Methods\u201d tab). Specifically, these figures indicate that fraud reports for payments apps or\nservices, bank transfers or payments, wire transfers, and checks have increased from 145,358 in 2020,\nresulting in a loss of $806 million, to more than 188,000 in 2024, resulting in a loss of $2.99 billion.\n4 Compare FinCEN, SAR Filings by Industry \u2013 Depository Institution, https:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/reports\/sar-\nstats\/sar-filings-industry (Exhibit 5: Number of Filings by Type of Suspicious Activity from Depository\nInstitution Industry, 2024 data) with FinCEN, Suspicious Activity Report Statistics (SAR Stats),\nhttps:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/reports\/sar-stats (Industry Type: Depository Institution, Year & Month: 2024 (all\nmonths), Suspicious Activity Category\/Type: Fraud > ACH, Check, Wire).\n8 of 22 The rise in check fraud is particularly notable. Numerous sources report\nincreasing levels of check fraud in recent years, despite overall decreases in check usage.5\nChecks can be stolen, altered, or forged. For instance, the physical nature of paper\nchecks makes them susceptible to theft while in transit or when left in unsecured\nlocations. Products and services to detect altered or forged checks during the clearing\nprocess have varying degrees of effectiveness given that checks do not inherently include\nexplicit security features. Checks also contain sensitive information\u2014including the\npayor\u2019s name, account number, routing number, address, and signature\u2014that can be used\nby criminals to conduct other forms of payments fraud.\nA payments fraud scheme may involve multiple institutions and payment\nmethods, each of which may fall within the remit of different Federal and State agencies.\nAs a result, and given the scope and complexity of payments fraud schemes, no agency or\nprivate-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. The Board, FDIC, and OCC\nnonetheless may be able to take certain discrete steps, collectively or independently, to\nmitigate payments fraud through their various roles discussed further below, such as\nregulator and supervisor. In addition, Reserve Banks may be able to further support the\nindustry in addressing fraud as payments system operator and payments improvement\ncatalyst.\nTherefore, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC are considering whether additional actions\nmay be warranted, collectively or independently in their different roles. Given the\n5 For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury reports that check fraud in the United States has risen\n385 percent since the COVID-19 pandemic. See Department of the Treasury, Treasury Announces\nEnhanced Fraud Detection Process Using AI Recovers $375M in Fiscal Year 2023 (Feb. 28, 2024),\nhttps:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy2134. FinCEN reports that check fraud accounted for\napproximately 30 percent of fraud-related SARs filed in 2023. See SAR Stats,\nhttps:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/reports\/sar-stats.\n9 of 22 complexity and scope of payments fraud, input and engagement from a variety of\nstakeholders will be helpful to identify and evaluate the range of potential actions to\nconsider.\nIII. Request for Information\nAs explained below, comment is requested on five potential areas for\nimprovement and collaboration that could help mitigate payments fraud:\n\uf0b7 External collaboration (questions 1\u20134)\n\uf0b7 Consumer, business, and industry education (questions 5\u20138)\n\uf0b7 Regulation and supervision (questions 9\u201315)\n\uf0b7 Payments fraud data collection and information sharing (questions 16\u201320)\n\uf0b7 Reserve Banks\u2019 operator tools and services (questions 21\u201322)\nCommenters are also invited to provide perspectives related to payments fraud more\ngenerally (questions 23-26).\nWhere comments apply to only a subset of the FRS, FDIC, and OCC, please\nidentify the relevant entity or entities.\nExternal Collaboration\nThe FRS, FDIC, and OCC collaborate with stakeholders in various ways to\nsupport the safety and efficiency of the U.S. financial system. For example, the Board,\nFDIC, and OCC, together with other Federal and State agencies, issued guidance on elder\nfinancial exploitation.6 More recently, the Reserve Banks collaborated with various\n6 See Interagency Statement on Elder Financial Exploitation (Dec. 4, 2024),\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/pressreleases\/bcreg20241204a.htm;\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/system\/files\/2024-12\/interagency-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation.pdf; and\nhttps:\/\/www.occ.gov\/news-issuances\/bulletins\/2024\/bulletin-2024-34.html.\n10 of 22 industry stakeholders to launch the FraudClassifierSM model in 2020 and\nScamClassifierSM model in 2024 to help address the industry-wide challenge of\ninconsistent classifications for payments fraud.7 Additionally, the FRS in its role as\npayment system improvement catalyst worked with the payments and banking industry\nand other stakeholders to develop strategies for improving the U.S. payments system,\nwhich resulted in the introduction of instant payments in the United States.8 There may\nbe opportunities to facilitate further collaboration among industry stakeholders to better\naddress payments fraud. Commenters are invited to respond to the following questions:\n1. What actions could increase collaboration among stakeholders to address\npayments fraud?\n2. What types of collaboration, including standard setting, could be most effective in\naddressing payments fraud? What are some of the biggest obstacles to these types\nof collaboration?\n3. Which organizations outside of the payments or banking industry might provide\nadditional insights related to payments fraud and be effective collaborators in\ndetecting, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?\n4. Could increased collaboration among Federal and State agencies help detect,\nprevent, and mitigate payments fraud? If so, how?\n7 See https:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org\/strategic-initiatives\/payments-security\/fraudclassifier-model\/\nand https:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org\/strategic-initiatives\/payments-security\/scams\/scamclassifier-\nmodel\/.\n8 See Federal Reserve System, Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System (Jan. 26, 2015),\nhttps:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/strategies-improving-us-payment-system.pdf.\n11 of 22 Consumer, Business, and Industry Education\nConsumers, businesses, financial institutions, and other industry stakeholders\ncurrently have access to education on a range of financial topics, including payments\nfraud.9 However, there may be a need for further education specific to payments fraud.\nEffective payments fraud education could, for example, help industry stakeholders\nidentify suspected payments fraud and better inform affected parties about what steps to\ntake following an incident of payments fraud. The effectiveness of any payments fraud\neducation, however, may be undermined by the ever-evolving nature of payments fraud,\nthe highly specific and sensitive nature of these crimes, and the range of potentially\ninconsistent guidance from multiple sources.\nTo assist in developing potential new payments fraud education, commenters are\ninvited to respond to the following questions:\n5. In general, what types of payments fraud education are most effective, and why?\nWould different audiences (for example, industry and consumers) benefit from\ndifferent types of payments fraud education?\n6. Would additional education informing consumers and businesses about safe\npayment practices be helpful to reduce payments fraud and promote access to\nsafe, secure payment options?\n9 For example, the OCC recently launched \u201cSafe Money,\u201d a series of informational facts sheets to help\nconsumers recognize and avoid common financial frauds and scams at https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/publications-\nand-resources\/publications\/safe-money\/index-safe-money.html. The Federal Reserve offers consumer\nadvice and educational resources on its website at\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/consumerscommunities\/fraud-scams.htm and through each Reserve Bank\u2019s\nwebsite. The Federal Reserve also provides consumer alerts, an avenue for consumer complaints, and other\nrelevant resources on payments fraud at https:\/\/www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov. The FDIC provides\nperiodic newsletters to consumers, providing practical guidance on how to become a smarter, safer user of\nfinancial services, including helpful hints, quick tips, and common-sense strategies to protect and stretch\nyour hard-earned dollars. This includes topics such as scammers, fake banks, or fraud against the elderly.\nSee https:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/consumer-resource-center\/fdic-consumer-news for more information.\n12 of 22 7. Which approaches could make existing payments fraud education more effective?\nFor example, would targeting outreach to particular audiences or conducting\nadditional education in collaboration with other key stakeholders be effective?\n8. Are current online resources effective in providing education on payments fraud?\nIf not, how could they be improved?10\nRegulation and Supervision\nWhile no agency has plenary regulatory or supervisory authority over the U.S.\npayments system, the Board, FDIC, and OCC have certain limited, and in some cases\nunique, statutory authorities that may apply to payments fraud.11 For example, the Board,\nFDIC, and OCC supervise their respective financial institutions for compliance with their\nobligations under the Bank Secrecy Act\/Anti-Money Laundering regime to identify,\nprevent, and report illicit financial activity including fraud. Additionally, the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act requires the protection of nonpublic personal information as\nimplemented by the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security\nStandards.12 The Board, FDIC, and OCC also supervise their respective financial\n10 Examples of online resources include https:\/\/www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov;\nhttps:\/\/fedpaymentsimprovement.org; https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/consumerscommunities\/fraud-\nscams.htm; https:\/\/explore.fednow.org\/explore-the-city?id=11&building=fraud-control-tower;\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/consumer- resource-center\/consumer-assistance-topics;\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/consumer-resource-center\/fdic-consumer-news; https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/publications-\nand-resources\/publications\/safe-money\/index-safe-money.html; and https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/topics\/consumers-\nand-communities\/consumer-protection\/fraud-resources\/index-fraud-resources.html.\n11 While no single Federal agency has regulatory authority to address all aspects of payments fraud, there\nare a variety of Federal and State laws and regulations applicable to payments fraud detection, mitigation,\nand resolution, often specific to the type of transaction and parties involved.\n12 The Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards (Guidelines) set forth standards\npursuant to section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, and sections 501 and\n505(b), 15 U.S.C. 6801 and 6805(b), of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These Guidelines address standards\nfor developing and implementing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security,\nconfidentiality, and integrity of customer information. These Guidelines also address standards with respect\nto the proper disposal of consumer information pursuant to sections 621 and 628 of the Fair Credit\nReporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s and 1681w).\n13 of 22 institutions for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, such as the\nExpedited Funds Availability Act (implemented in Regulation CC), the Electronic Fund\nTransfer Act (implemented in Regulation E), the Truth in Lending Act (implemented in\nRegulation Z), and prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.13\nAlthough the Board, FDIC, and OCC believe that they are exercising their authorities\nappropriately, there may be opportunities to take additional regulatory or supervisory\nactions to address payments fraud within their authorities and, where appropriate, in\ncoordination with other agencies.\nIn considering potential additional regulatory or supervisory actions to mitigate\npayments fraud, the Board, FDIC, and OCC seek comment on the following questions.\nAdditionally, there may be opportunities specific to check fraud that the Board could\nconsider with respect to Regulation CC given its rule-writing authority, which is\ndiscussed separately below.\n9. What potential changes to regulations (apart from the Board\u2019s Regulation CC,\ndiscussed separately below) could address payments fraud and mitigate the harms\nfrom payments fraud to consumers, businesses, and supervised institutions?\n10. The Board, FDIC, and OCC have issued supervisory guidance on numerous\ntopics that relate to payments fraud detection, prevention, and mitigation.14 Is\n13 The Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFA Act), among other things, prescribes the maximum\npermissible hold periods for checks and other deposits. The Board implements certain provisions of the\nEFA Act with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n14 The Board, FDIC, and OCC have issued supervisory guidance on operational risk management,\ncompliance risk management, third-party risk management, and model risk management. For example, the\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council, of which the Board, FDIC, and OCC are members,\nissued guidance that provides financial institutions with examples of effective authentication and access\nrisk management principles, and practices for customers, employees, and third parties accessing digital\nbanking services and information systems. See Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council,\nAuthentication and Access to Financial Institution Services and Systems (Aug. 11, 2021),\n14 of 22 existing supervisory guidance related to payments fraud sufficient and clear? If\nnot, what new or revised supervisory guidance should the Board, FDIC, and OCC\nconsider issuing on this topic within the respective authorities?\n11. How might new or revised supervisory guidance assist small community banks in\ndetecting, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?\n12. What is the experience of consumers and businesses when supervised institutions\nplace holds on depositors\u2019 funds because of suspected payments fraud?\n(Regulation CC\u2019s \u201creasonable cause to doubt collectability\u201d exception is\ndiscussed separately below.)\na) For instance, how frequently are consumers and businesses affected by\nholds, delays, or account freezes, and how responsive are supervised\ninstitutions to inquiries from consumers and businesses regarding these\nissues?\nb) Do current disclosure requirements effectively address consumer and\nbusiness concerns when supervised institutions hold customer funds due to\nsuspected payments fraud? For example, should changes be considered\nwith respect to permissible customer communications under SAR\nconfidentiality rules?\nhttps:\/\/www.ffiec.gov\/guidance\/Authentication-and-Access-to-Financial-Institution-Services-and-\nSystems.pdf. The Board, FDIC, and OCC, together with other Federal and State agencies, issued guidance\non elder financial exploitation. See Interagency Statement on Elder Financial Exploitation (Dec. 4, 2024),\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/pressreleases\/bcreg20241204a.htm;\nhttps:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/system\/files\/2024-12\/interagency-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation.pdf; and\nhttps:\/\/www.occ.gov\/topics\/consumers-and-communities\/consumer-protection\/fraud-resources\/index-fraud-\nresources.html. As required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Federal banking agencies have issued\ninteragency guidelines establishing information security standards. See, e.g., 12 CFR part 208, app. D-2,\nand part 225, app. F. Finally, OCC Bulletin 2019-37 outlines sound fraud risk management principles at\nhttps:\/\/www.occ.treas.gov\/news-issuances\/bulletins\/2019\/bulletin-2019-37.html.\n15 of 22 13. The Board, FDIC, and OCC have received complaints from supervised\ninstitutions regarding challenges in resolving disputes about liability for allegedly\nfraudulent checks.15 What is the experience of supervised institutions when trying\nto resolve these types of interbank disputes regarding allegedly fraudulent checks?\nDo these types of interbank disputes arise more frequently in connection with\ncertain types of checks or parties? What actions could the Board, FDIC, and OCC\nconsider, including potential amendments by the Board to Regulation CC, that\ncould improve supervised institutions\u2019 ability to resolve interbank disputes over\nliability for allegedly fraudulent checks?\nAlthough the Board is not proposing any changes to Regulation CC at this time,\nthe Board seeks comment on the following questions:\n14. Regulation CC seeks to balance prompt funds availability with the risk of checks\nbeing returned unpaid for reasons that include fraud. What potential amendments\nto Regulation CC would support timely access to funds from check deposits while\nproviding depository institutions with sufficient time to identify suspected\npayments fraud?\na) Have technological advancements in check processing reduced the time it\ntakes for depository institutions to learn of nonpayment or fraud such that\nfunds availability requirements for local checks and nonproprietary ATMs\nshould be shortened?16\n15 The Board, OCC, and FDIC have each established mailboxes to receive interbank complaints about this\nissue concerning their supervised financial institutions.\n16 The funds availability requirements for cash deposits, wire transfers, and government and certain other\ntypes of checks are established by the EFA Act. See 12 U.S.C. 4002(a). The EFA Act requires the Board\nand CFPB to reduce the time periods for certain other check and ATM deposits to as short a time as\n16 of 22 b) What effects would shortening funds availability requirements have on\npayments fraud, consumers who rely on timely access to funds, and\ndepository institutions?\nc) Are there any changes the Board should consider to the expeditious return\nrequirement to better balance providing expeditious notice to the receiving\ndepository institution with ensuring adequate time for the paying\ndepository institution to investigate potentially fraudulent checks?17\n15. Regulation CC provides six exceptions that allow depository institutions to extend\ndeposit hold periods for certain types of deposits, including deposits for which the\ndepository institution has reasonable cause to doubt the collectability of a\ncheck.18 Is this exception effective in allowing depository institutions to mitigate\ncheck fraud while also allowing timely access to funds? Would depository\ninstitutions benefit from further clarification on when it may be appropriate to\ninvoke this exception? What are the experiences of businesses and consumers\nwhen depository institutions invoke this exception in order to delay the\navailability of depositors\u2019 funds?\npossible and equal to the period of time achievable for a receiving depository institution to reasonably\nexpect to learn of the nonpayment of most items for each category. 12 U.S.C. 4002(d)(1). In October\n2024, an interested person submitted a rulemaking petition to the Board and CFPB requesting that both\nagencies engage in a rulemaking process to shorten maximum permissible hold times for checks and funds\ndeposited by customers. The Board views this rulemaking petition as an additional consideration related to\nthe issuance of this RFI. In response to the growth in electronic processing, the Reserve Banks reduced the\nnumber of their paper check-processing offices from 45 in 2003 to a single office in 2010. The\nconsolidation resulted in all checks being considered \"local checks\" under Regulation CC.\n17 Regulation CC requires a depository institution that determines not to pay a check to return the check\nexpeditiously so that receiving depository institutions are more likely to learn of a return before making\nfunds available. See 12 CFR 229.31(b).\n18 See 12 CFR 229.13(e).\n17 of 22 Payments Fraud Data Collection and Information Sharing\nPayments fraud data, such as value and volume of fraudulent payments and\nindustry negative lists, is currently collected in an incomplete, non-standardized, ad hoc,\nand fragmented way.19 For example, not all entities in the payments and banking\nindustry collect payments fraud data, especially authorized payments that are a part of a\nscam or fraud. Further, existing data sources may focus on particular payment methods,\ntypes of payments fraud, or segments of the industry, and may use different definitions of\npayments fraud. Further promoting, standardizing, and centralizing payments fraud data\ncollection and information sharing could provide a more comprehensive understanding of\nthe prevalence and impact of payments fraud. These improvements also could aid in\nidentifying payments fraud schemes that are being repeated across payment methods and\ninstitutions, allowing for the development of more-informed, holistic strategies to address\npayments fraud.\nHowever, there may be barriers to improving payments fraud data collection and\ninformation sharing. Payments fraud may be underreported because of the reluctance of\nvictims to report fraud due to embarrassment or shame, confusion regarding the proper\nreporting channel, and a perception that reporting does not lead to remediation. Further,\n19 For example, the FTC maintains a website where consumers can report payments fraud. See\nhttps:\/\/reportfraud.ftc.gov. The FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center is the main federal law\nenforcement hub for reporting cyber-enabled crime, which includes payments fraud. See\nhttps:\/\/www.ic3.gov\/AnnualReport\/Reports\/2024_IC3Report.pdf. In addition, depository institutions are\nrequired to file SARs with FinCEN following suspected incidents of payments fraud. FRS has previously\ncollected payments fraud data in connection with its Federal Reserve Payments Study, which it published\nin 2014 and 2018. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, The 2013 Federal Reserve\nPayments Study: Recent and Long-Term Payment Trends in the United States: 2000-2012 (July 2014),\nhttps:\/\/www.frbservices.org\/binaries\/content\/assets\/crsocms\/news\/research\/2013-fed-res-paymt-study-\ndetailed-rpt.pdf. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Changes in U.S. Payments Fraud\nfrom 2012 to 2016: Evidence from the Federal Reserve Payments Study (Oct. 2018),\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/publications\/files\/changes-in-us-payments-fraud-from-2012-to-2016-\n20181016.pdf.\n18 of 22 potential risks associated with sharing payments fraud\u2013related information may prevent\nsharing across stakeholders.\nTo assist in potentially promoting improved payments fraud data collection and\ninformation sharing, commenters are invited to respond to the following questions:\n16. Broadly, how could payments fraud data collection and information sharing be\nimproved?\n17. What barriers limit the collection and sharing of payments fraud data between\nindustry stakeholders, and how could these barriers be alleviated? For example,\nhave specific barriers limited development of solutions or participation in\nbilaterial or multilateral payments fraud data collection and information sharing?\nWhat changes would address these barriers?\n18. What role should the FRS, FDIC, or OCC take in supporting further\nstandardization of payments fraud data? For instance, can the FRS better leverage\nor improve the FraudClassifierSM and ScamClassifierSM models?\n19. What types of payments fraud data, if available, would have the largest impact on\naddressing payments fraud? If these data are not currently being collected or\nshared, what entities are best positioned to collect and share such data?\n20. Is there a need for centralized databases or repositories for the sharing of\npayments fraud data across entities? What legal, privacy, or practical risks and\nchallenges could such a centralized database or repository pose? Which entities\nare best positioned to develop and participate in a centralized database or\nrepository?\n19 of 22 Reserve Banks\u2019 Operator Tools and Services\nThe Reserve Banks offer check processing, ACH transfers, instant payments, and\nwire services, among other services. In this operational role, the Reserve Banks have\ntaken important steps to prevent and mitigate payments fraud. For example, the Reserve\nBanks provide risk management tools and services that participating financial institutions\nmay use as part of their payments fraud detection, prevention, and mitigation programs.20\nThe FRS believes that there may be further opportunities for the Reserve Banks, as a\npayments system operator, to provide additional tools and services designed to reduce\npayments fraud.\nIn considering potential additional actions the Reserve Banks can take in their\noperator role to mitigate payments fraud, commenters are invited to respond to the\nfollowing questions:\n21. How can the Reserve Banks enhance their existing risk management tools and\nservices, operations, rules, or procedures to better meet the needs of participating\nfinancial institutions in addressing payments fraud? For example, should the\nReserve Banks consider requiring fraud reporting for payment rails (as they\nalready do for the FedNow\u00ae Service) or adopting any particular payments fraud\nstandards?\n20 See https:\/\/www.frbservices.org for more information on Reserve Bank financial services, including risk\nmanagement and fraud tools and services. Examples of these tools and services include FedDetect\u00ae\nAnomaly Notification for FedACH\u00ae Services, FedACH\u00ae Exception Resolution Service, FedDetect\u00ae\nDuplicate Notification for Check Services, FedACH\u00ae Risk Origination Monitoring Service, FedACH\u00ae\nRDFI File Alert Service, FedPayments\u00ae Reporter for Check Services Corporate Payor Report, FedNow\u00ae\nService network- and participant-level transaction limits, and FedNow\u00ae Service participant defined\nnegative lists.\n20 of 22 22. Are there risk management tools or services that the Reserve Banks should\nconsider offering or expanding, such as a) developing a payments fraud contact\ndirectory for financial institutions, b) offering tools that can provide notification\nof atypical payment activity, or c) introducing confirmation of payee services to\nhelp mitigate fraudulent payment origination?21\nGeneral Questions\nIn addition to the more specific questions above, commenters are invited to\nrespond to the following general questions related to payments fraud:\n23. What types of payments fraud have most impacted your organization and its\nstakeholders? What tactics have criminals employed when perpetrating these\ntypes of payments fraud?\n24. What measures, including technological solutions or services, have been most\neffective in identifying, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud at your\ninstitution? Are there actions that consumers can take that help institutions? For\nexample, do financial institutions find it helpful when consumers alert the\ninstitution in advance when making large purchases, transferring large amounts of\nmoney, and traveling abroad?\n25. To the extent not already addressed here, are there other actions that would\nsupport stakeholders in identifying, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?\n21 Some payments systems have implemented services known as confirmation of payee, which are designed\nto reduce payments fraud by enabling senders to review key payment information, such as the name\nassociated with the intended account.\n21 of 22 26. Are there specific actions that commenters believe could encourage the use of\npayment methods with strong security features?\nThe Honorable Rodney E.

The OCC\u2019s Preemption Regulations Are Lawful\nYour letter claims that the OCC\u2019s preemption regulations are unlawful because they are not\nconsistent with the best reading of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct (Dodd\u2013Frank).1\nContrary to your assertions, the OCC\u2019s preemption regulations are wholly consistent with Dodd\u2013\nFrank and Supreme Court precedent and thus meet the requirements of EO 14219. For your\nawareness, the OCC reviewed its preemption regulations following Dodd\u2013Frank\u2019s enactment.\nThe OCC considered the relevant statutory language, legislative history, and judicial precedent\nand concluded that Dodd\u2013Frank codified the conflict preemption standard in Barnett Bank of\nMarion County, N.A. v. Nelson, including the antecedent cases it cited. This conclusion is\nconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in Cantero v. Bank of America, N.A.,\nwhich rejects arguments that Dodd\u2013Frank created a new preemption standard and instead notes\nthat \u201cDodd\u2013Frank adopted Barnett\u201d and that Barnett \u201cwas also the governing preemption\n1 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 25b(b)(1)(B). For additional information regarding Dodd\u2013Frank\u2019s procedural requirements, refer to\nOCC Interpretive Letter 1173 (Dec. 18, 2020) (Chief Counsel\u2019s Interpretation issued by Senior Deputy Comptroller\nand Chief Counsel Jonathan V. Gould). standard before Dodd\u2013Frank.\u201d2 The OCC applied this same standard when it identified certain\npreempted and non-preempted state laws in its regulations in 2004 and again when it reviewed\nthe regulations in 2011.3 The OCC\u2019s regulations are consistent with applicable law.\nII. The OCC\u2019s Regulations Support Efficient and Effective Operations\nYou also suggest that the OCC\u2019s preemption regulations are anti-competitive. This is not the\ncase. In addition, the OCC\u2019s regulations are consistent with EO 14267. Federal preemption is a\ncornerstone of the dual banking system, under which federally and state-chartered banks operate\nalongside one another. As the Supreme Court recognized in Cantero, this system allows\nfederally and state-chartered banks to \u201cco-exist and compete.\u201d4\nFederal preemption has proven to be a powerful enabler of local and national prosperity and\ngrowth. As the Supreme Court noted at the beginning of the twentieth century, federal legislation\nand regulation \u201chas in view the erection of a system extending throughout the country, and\nindependent, so far as powers conferred are concerned, of state legislation which, if permitted to\nbe applicable, might impose limitations and restrictions as various and as numerous as the\n[s]tates.\u201d5 Federally chartered banks, many of which operate across state lines, therefore may\nrely on preemption to remove barriers and achieve efficiencies associated with a uniform set of\nrules. Thus, federal preemption has helped to foster the development of national products and\nservices and multi-state markets, which have benefitted individuals and businesses in every state\nand powered this Nation\u2019s economy.\nIII. Conclusion\nThank you for sharing your views on this important matter. The OCC has thoroughly considered\nthe points you raised and, as set forth above, reaffirms that its preemption regulations are valid\nunder applicable law and are critical to ensuring the continued strength of our Nation\u2019s banking\nsystem.\nSincerely,\n\/signed\/\nRodney E.

    "cleaned_text":"Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce Capital Markets Forum\nJune 3, 2025\nGood morning and thank you for that kind introduction.\nIt is a privilege to be here with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2014an institution that has long\nchampioned American enterprise, innovation, and opportunity. Your membership represents the\nbeating heart of our nation\u2019s economic vitality\u2014from local businesses and community lenders to\nthe most sophisticated participants in our capital markets.\nToday, I am honored to share with you how the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is\nactively fostering a financial system that is not only resilient, but resurgent.\nAs Acting Comptroller of the Currency, I have the honor of leading the agency that oversees our\nfederal banking system\u2014an enduring pillar of American strength and resilience. At the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, we supervise more than 1,000 national banks and\nfederal savings associations that collectively hold nearly $16 trillion in assets. These institutions\nrepresent two-thirds of the U.S. banking system and play a foundational role in supporting\nhousehold financial health, entrepreneurship, and broad-based economic growth.\nEvery day, I am focused on ensuring that our banks operate in a safe, sound, and fair manner\u2014\nwhile enabling them to adapt, compete, and thrive in a rapidly changing financial landscape. Our\ncountry stands at a pivotal moment. While the American financial system remains among the\nmost advanced and stable in the world, we face new challenges\u2014and new opportunities\u2014that\ndemand bold thinking, strategic investment, and dynamic innovation.\nTo reignite our economic momentum, we must modernize responsibly, invest with vision, and\nempower our financial institutions to serve as catalysts for enduring and inclusive growth.\nA Legacy of Stability, A Mandate for Renewal\nThe OCC\u2019s founding mission stretches back to 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln signed\nthe National Currency Act into law. Amid the tumult of the Civil War, Lincoln recognized that\nfinancial cohesion and confidence were not luxuries\u2014but necessities. A fragmented banking\nsystem could not support a unified nation. And so, the OCC was created to provide regulatory\nclarity, consistency, and credibility. More than 160 years later, we face different challenges\u2014but our mandate remains timeless: to\nsafeguard trust and to empower progress.\nToday, that progress depends on a federal banking system that is both principled and dynamic\u2014\ncapable of supporting bold investment, driving technological innovation, and serving as a\nbedrock for America\u2019s renewed economic growth.\nSince stepping into the role as Acting Comptroller, I have focused our agenda around four (4)\nbold strategies that I believe will chart a path for American financial resurgence:\n1. Accelerating bank-fintech partnerships\n2. Expanding responsible engagement with digital assets\n3. Advancing financial inclusion as an economic imperative\n4. Modernizing regulation to unleash growth\nEach pillar is grounded in the belief that America\u2019s economic vitality depends on a forward-\nlooking banking system\u2014one that embraces innovation, ensures inclusion, and operates under\nsmart, effective regulation.\nPlease allow me to now touch briefly on each.\n1. Accelerating Bank-Fintech Partnerships\nInnovation is the currency of progress. In today\u2019s digital economy, the question is no longer\nwhether banks should innovate, but how\u2014and how fast.\nAt the OCC, we\u2019ve taken meaningful steps to foster safe, responsible innovation. In 2016, we\nbecame the first federal bank regulator to establish an Office of Innovation. Today, that vision\ncontinues through our Office of Financial Technology\u2014a specialized unit of experts dedicated to\nevaluating advances in financial technology, engaging with market participants, and shaping\nguidance that reflects a fast-evolving ecosystem.\nWe\u2019ve embraced agile tools like regulatory sandboxes, TechSprints, and virtual office hours to\nhelp banks and fintechs develop, test, and launch innovative solutions within a responsible\nframework. These efforts allow institutions to better serve customers, broaden access, and\nrespond to changing expectations.\nA recent example: The OCC granted conditional approval to a national bank\u2019s transformation\ninto a technology-driven small business lender. This decision supported a responsible,\nnationwide platform designed to increase access to credit for America\u2019s entrepreneurs\u2014many of\nwhom operate in underserved communities.\nEarlier this year, I also visited the BIS Innovation Hub in London to explore global\ndevelopments in financial technology. We are applying those insights at home, building a\nregulatory posture that encourages innovation while preserving our core values of safety and\nsoundness.\n2 2. Expanding Responsible Engagement With Digital Assets\nDigital assets and distributed ledger technologies are not a passing trend; they are the\narchitecture of a new financial frontier. Today, over 50 million Americans hold some form of\ncryptocurrency. Digital assets and distributed ledger technologies represent hundreds of billions\nof dollars in activity and are rapidly becoming infrastructure for payments, custody, and capital\nformation.\nWhen I assumed office, banks lacked clarity about how to engage with digital assets. Many were\nunsure whether they could proceed\u2014and whether years of investment could vanish overnight in\na fog of regulatory ambiguity and uncertainty.\nWe changed that.\nIn March, the OCC issued Interpretive Letter 1183, removing the requirement that banks seek a\nprior \u201cnon-objection\u201d to engage in permissible digital asset activities. Instead, we now require\nthat banks demonstrate appropriate risk management frameworks\u2014ensuring consistency,\ntransparency, and strategic alignment.\nThat single action restored confidence in regulatory clarity and allowed banks to proceed with\ninnovation in a way that is both prudent and purposeful.\nBeyond digital assets, we are also monitoring emerging technologies like generative AI, agentic\nAI, and quantum computing, which hold potential to revolutionize underwriting, fraud detection,\nand customer engagement. Many banks are already exploring AI to enhance decision-making\nand improve efficiency. But for community banks, the path forward is not always as clear.\nThat\u2019s why we issued a Request for Information (RFI) earlier this year, seeking direct input on\nthe unique challenges community banks face when adopting digital solutions. Our goal is to\ndevelop guidance, tools, and partnerships that help ensure that all banks\u2014not just the largest\u2014\ncan modernize and remain competitive.\n3. Advancing Financial Inclusion as an Economic Imperative\nIf innovation is the engine of growth, then inclusion is its moral and economic compass.\nDespite the sophistication of our financial system, tens of millions of Americans remain on its\nmargins. Nearly 40 percent of U.S. households cannot absorb a $400 emergency. Roughly\n70 million individuals are credit invisible or unscorable. This is not just a gap in access\u2014it is a\ndrag on productivity, resilience, and national potential.\nThat is why I have said\u2014and continue to believe\u2014that financial inclusion is the civil rights issue\nof our time.\n3 In response, the OCC launched Project REACh\u2014the Roundtable for Economic Access and\nChange. This public-private collaboration brings together leaders in banking, civil rights,\ncommunity development, and technology to forge actionable solutions.\nOur workstreams focus on expanding affordable housing, growing small businesses, supporting\nminority depository institutions, and leveraging fintech for financial empowerment. Project\nREACh has already delivered results\u2014developing alternative credit scoring models, increasing\ncapital access for underserved communities, and breaking down systemic barriers to economic\nparticipation.\nWe recently restructured our Office of External Relations and Strategic Partnerships under the\nleadership of my Chief of Staff and National Director for Project REACh, Andrew Moss. This\nteam is developing a comprehensive financial inclusion strategy that engages the entire financial\necosystem to promote opportunity, mobility, and shared prosperity.\n4. Modernizing Regulation to Unleash Growth\nNow to the fourth and perhaps most consequential pillar: right-sizing regulation to unlock the\nfull potential of our banking system. Regulation must protect\u2014but it must also empower.\nFrom the beginning of my tenure, I\u2019ve made it clear: Regulations must be effective\u2014not\nexcessive. They must protect the public interest while enabling banks to fuel investment, drive\ninnovation, and serve their communities.\nWe categorically reject a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, the OCC employs risk-based\nsupervision, tailoring oversight to each bank\u2019s size, complexity, and business model. This\nensures that every institution is evaluated based on its individual profile\u2014not a rigid template.\nWe are actively engaged in the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act\n(EGRPRA) decennial review process, seeking to identify and eliminate outdated, duplicative, or\nunnecessarily burdensome regulations. This is a critical opportunity for us\u2014and for all of you\u2014\nto streamline rules that no longer reflect today\u2019s financial realities. I urge you to participate in\nthis process and help us shape a regulatory framework that supports growth without\ncompromising safety.\nIn addition to EGRPRA, we\u2019ve taken several concrete actions:\n\u2022 We withdrew proposed climate-related risk management principles for large banks,\nrecognizing that existing guidance already equips banks to manage all forms of risk\u2014\nincluding those from extreme weather or other exceptional events.\n\u2022 We ceased examining for \u201creputation risk\u201d\u2014a move that enhances transparency and\nreinforces that business decisions belong to banks, not to regulators. By focusing\nsupervisory attention on clear, well-defined risk categories, we provide certainty that\nallows banks to serve all legal businesses, consistent with their policies and risk\ntolerance.\n4 \u2022 We are also focused on modernizing capital standards. While U.S. banks remain the gold\nstandard of international finance, that doesn\u2019t mean we must \u201cgold-plate\u201d our capital\nrequirements. I\u2019ve engaged extensively with my U.S. and global counterparts to advocate\nfor capital levels that are strong, but appropriate\u2014not excessive.\nAt a recent meeting in Basel, I conveyed that sentiment directly. I was heartened to see\nconsensus from the international community that the U.S. proposal had gone beyond what was\nnecessary. As we continue interagency deliberations, I will remain committed to a capital\nframework that supports resilience\u2014but does not constrain growth.\nWe are also examining adjustments to the supplementary leverage ratio to ensure it functions as\na true backstop\u2014not a primary constraint that limits lending unnecessarily.\nFinally, on bank mergers: In April, the OCC approved a complex merger after rigorous review of\nits impacts on consumers, competition, and the broader financial system. We also issued an\ninterim final rule restoring streamlined application and expedited review procedures, ensuring\nthat well-managed and well-capitalized institutions can merge responsibly\u2014supporting scale,\ninnovation, and economic vitality.\nConclusion: Reigniting America\u2019s Financial Future\nLet me close by returning to our founding under President Lincoln. In a time of national\nchallenge, Lincoln understood that a strong, unified financial system was essential to building a\nstronger Union. That wisdom holds true today.\nHe once said, \u201cThe best way to predict the future is to create it.\u201d\nThat is what we are doing at the OCC. We are creating a regulatory environment where\nAmerican banks can lead the world in innovation, inclusion, and investment\u2014while maintaining\nthe prudence that has long been our competitive advantage.\nActing Comptroller does not mean inactive Comptroller. I am proud of what we\u2019ve\naccomplished in a short time\u2014and even more excited about what lies ahead.\nThis is America\u2019s moment for financial resurgence. Let\u2019s seize it together\u2014with courage, with\nclarity, and with a shared commitment to growth that benefits every corner of this great nation.\nThank you.\n5",

    "cleaned_text":"Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood\nFinancial Literacy and Education Commission Public Meeting\nThe Why and How of Measuring Financial Education Outcomes\nMay 29, 2025\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for hosting today\u2019s meeting. I am so pleased to be\nhere with my colleagues on the Financial Literacy and Education Commission.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency was created in 1863 during Abraham Lincoln\u2019s\npresidency to create a safe, sound, and reliable banking and monetary system to help unify the\nnation. The OCC\u2019s work today stems from this founding purpose. Our mission is to ensure that\nthe more than 1,000 institutions we supervise operate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair\naccess to financial services, treat customers fairly, and comply with applicable laws and\nregulations.\nFinancial literacy education plays a key part in driving financial inclusion and participation in\nour financial system. Financial education empowers more people to better use financial products\nand services to manage their day-to-day needs; access capital to invest in themselves, their\nbusinesses, and their communities; and build wealth for themselves and future generations.\nFinancial literacy helps consumers to preserve their well-being by avoiding frauds and scams.\nAnd financial education can help children and youth gain fundamental skills and practices that\nwill benefit them as they grow up.\nThe OCC has long supported banks\u2019 work to promote financial education for their customers and\ntheir communities by providing information and resources on best practices, like our quarterly\nFinancial Literacy Update, our Insights reports on financial capability and other financial\nliteracy topics, and online resource directories. Our staff also facilitates connections between banks and community partners by organizing outreach events and training sessions virtually and\nin person around the country.\nOCC publications and resource directories point to best practices for financial literacy and\neducation programs that emphasize the importance of evaluating the programs\u2019 impact and\neffectiveness. Additionally, the OCC encourages banks to consider how they can support\ncustomers\u2019 financial health. To do so, banks may look for ways to understand their customers\u2019\nchallenges; consider opportunities to provide responsive products and services; and take other\nsteps to support customer efforts to improve their financial position. As Abraham Lincoln noted,\n\u201cThe best way to predict the future is to create it.\u201d\nIn the banking sector and beyond, innovative technologies can create a future of delivering\nhelpful financial products to consumers in ways that are safe, sound, and cost-efficient. Everyone\nin the financial ecosystem \u2013 including financial educators \u2013 should carefully monitor the rapidly\nchanging financial marketplace and update financial education strategies accordingly. For\nexample, in 2023, almost 5 percent of all households owned or used cryptocurrency, with more\nthan nine in 10 of those holding it as an investment.1 Given the level of interest, expanding\nfinancial literacy resources to address digital asset investments may be useful.\nFinancial educators and asset building organizations can consider how to leverage interest in\ninvesting in digital assets to help consumers consider opportunities to engage in this product.\nDigital asset investors may be first-time investors, so it may be useful to draw upon other\ninvestor education efforts to help new investors succeed. I look forward to hearing from FLEC\nmembers and panelists on this topic today.\nThe OCC is pleased to work with our colleagues in the FLEC to highlight innovative and\neffective financial education resources to promote sustained financial well-being for all\nindividuals and families in the U.S. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for the opportunity to address this\nbody.\n1 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked\nHouseholds.\n2",

The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are: Cease and Desist Order against Eastern National Bank, Miami, Florida, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic and capital planning, earnings, and board and management supervision. (Docket No. AA-EC-2025-04). The OCC also terminated the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cease and desist order dated November 19, 2020 (AA-EC-2020-46), which was superseded by the newly issued cease and desist order. (Docket No. AA-EC-2025-10) Cease and Desist Order against EH National Bank, Beverly Hills, California, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to management and board supervision, strategic and capital planning, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and concentration risk. (Docket No. AA-WE-2025-20). The OCC also terminated the formal agreement with the bank dated October 11, 2023 (AA-WE-2023-37), which was replaced and superseded by the cease and desist order. (Docket No. AA-EC-2025-26) The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-45 | May 12, 2025 Agencies Issue Host State Loan-to-Deposit Ratios Share This Page: Joint Release Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Reserve Board Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Federal bank regulatory agencies today jointly issued updated host state loan-to-deposit ratios, as required by law. Each respective host state loan-to-deposit ratio shows the ratio of total loans in a state to total deposits in the state for all banks that have that state as their home state. These ratios replace those issued in May 2024. By law, a bank is generally prohibited from establishing or acquiring branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of acquiring additional deposits. This prohibition seeks to ensure that interstate bank branches will not take deposits from a community without the bank also reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of that community. The updated ratios, including additional information on how they are used to evaluate compliance with the requirements, are available here.

    "cleaned_text":"SECTION 109 HOST STATE LOAN-TO-DEPOSIT RATIOS\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)\n(collectively, the agencies) today are making public the host state loan-to-deposit ratios1 that the\nagencies will use to determine compliance with section 109 of the Riegle-Neal Interstate\nBanking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Interstate Act). In general, section 109 prohibits\na bank from establishing or acquiring a branch or branches outside of its home state primarily for\nthe purpose of deposit production. Section 106 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999\namended coverage of section 109 of the Interstate Act to include any branch of a bank controlled\nby an out-of-state bank holding company.\nTo determine compliance with section 109, the appropriate agency first compares a\nbank\u2019s estimated statewide loan-to-deposit ratio2 to the estimated host state loan-to-deposit ratio\nfor a particular state. If the bank\u2019s statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is at least one-half of the\npublished host state loan-to-deposit ratio, the bank has complied with section 109. A second step\nis conducted if a bank\u2019s estimated statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than one-half of the\npublished ratio for that state or if data are not available at the bank to conduct the first step. The\nsecond step requires the appropriate agency to determine whether the bank is reasonably helping\nto meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank\u2019s interstate branches. A bank\n1 The host state loan-to-deposit ratio is the ratio of total loans in a state to total deposits from the state for\nall banks that have that state as their home state. For state-chartered banks and FDIC-supervised savings banks, the\nhome state is the state where the bank was chartered. For national banks, the home state is the state where the\nbank\u2019s main office is located. The home state of a foreign bank is determined by 12 USC 3103(c) and applicable\nagency regulations at 12 CFR 28.11(n) (OCC), 12 CFR 211.22 (Board), and 12 CFR 347.202(m) (FDIC).\n2 The statewide loan-to-deposit ratio relates to an individual bank and is the ratio of a bank\u2019s loans to its\ndeposits in a particular state where the bank has interstate branches. that fails both steps is in violation of section 109 and subject to sanctions by the appropriate\nagency.\nSection 109 of the Interstate Banking and\nBranching Efficiency Act\nHost State Loan-to-Deposit Ratios\nUsing Data as of June 30, 2024\n(Excludes wholesale or limited purpose Community\nReinvestment Act-designated banks, credit card banks, and\nspecial purpose banks)\nHost State Loan-to-\nState or U.S. Territory\nDeposit Ratio\nAlabama 76%\nAlaska 66%\nArizona 82%\nArkansas 84%\nCalifornia 83%\nColorado 76%\nConnecticut 87%\nDelaware 66%\nDistrict of Columbia 94%\nFlorida 83%\nGeorgia 84%\nHawaii 74%\nIdaho 73%\nIllinois 79%\nIndiana 86%\nIowa 83%\nKansas 82%\nKentucky 84%\nLouisiana 83%\nMaine 96%\nMaryland 89%\n2 Section 109 of the Interstate Banking and\nBranching Efficiency Act\nHost State Loan-to-Deposit Ratios\nUsing Data as of June 30, 2024\n(Excludes wholesale or limited purpose Community\nReinvestment Act-designated banks, credit card banks, and\nspecial purpose banks)\nHost State Loan-to-\nState or U.S. Territory\nDeposit Ratio\nMassachusetts 96%\nMichigan 92%\nMinnesota 68%\nMississippi 80%\nMissouri 80%\nMontana 81%\nNebraska 87%\nNevada 89%\nNew Hampshire 99%\nNew Jersey 98%\nNew Mexico 61%\nNew York 69%\nNorth Carolina 63%\nNorth Dakota 86%\nOhio 73%\nOklahoma 86%\nOregon 88%\nPennsylvania 90%\nRhode Island 91%\nSouth Carolina 77%\nSouth Dakota 61%\nTennessee 86%\nTexas 72%\nUtah 85%\nVermont 88%\n3 Section 109 of the Interstate Banking and\nBranching Efficiency Act\nHost State Loan-to-Deposit Ratios\nUsing Data as of June 30, 2024\n(Excludes wholesale or limited purpose Community\nReinvestment Act-designated banks, credit card banks, and\nspecial purpose banks)\nHost State Loan-to-\nState or U.S. Territory\nDeposit Ratio\nVirginia 86%\nWashington 90%\nWest Virginia 83%\nWisconsin 91%\nWyoming 61%\nGuam 81%\nPuerto Rico 47%\nVirgin Islands 49%\nDue to the legislative intent against imposing regulatory burden, no additional data were\ncollected from institutions to implement section 109. However, since insufficient lending data\nwere available on a geographic basis to calculate the host state loan-to-deposit ratios directly, the\nagencies used a proxy to estimate the ratios. Accordingly, the agencies calculated the host state\nloan-to-deposit ratios using data obtained from the Consolidated Reports of Condition and\nIncome (call reports) and Summary of Deposits Surveys (summary of deposits), as of June 30,\n2024. For each home state bank, the agencies calculated the percentage of the bank\u2019s total\ndeposits attributable to branches located in its home state (determined from the summary of\ndeposits), and applied this percentage to the bank\u2019s total domestic loans (determined from the\ncall reports) to estimate the amount of loans attributable to the home state. The host state loan-\nto-deposit ratio was then calculated by separately totaling the loans and deposits for the home\nstate banks, and then dividing the sum of the loans by the sum of the deposits.\n4 Section 109 directs the agencies to determine, from relevant sources, the host state loan-\nto-deposit ratios. As discussed in the preamble to the joint final rule, Prohibition Against Use of\nInterstate Branches Primarily for Deposit Production (62 FR 47728, 47731, September 10,\n1997), implementing section 109, banks designated as wholesale or limited purpose banks under\nthe Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) were excluded from the host state loan-to-deposit\ncalculation, recognizing that these banks could have very large loan portfolios, but few, if any,\ndeposits. Likewise, credit card banks, which typically have large loan portfolios but few\ndeposits, were also excluded, regardless of whether they had a limited purpose designation for\nCRA purposes. Beginning in 2001, special purpose banks, including bankers\u2019 banks, were\nexcluded because these banks do not engage in traditional deposit taking or lending.\nThe estimated host state loan-to-deposit ratios, and any changes in the way the ratios are\ncalculated, will be publicized on an annual basis.\n5",

Background\nThe Bank Merger Act (BMA), section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\n(12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), and the OCC\u2019s implementing regulation, 12 CFR 5.33, govern the\nOCC\u2019s review of business combinations of national banks and Federal savings\nassociations with other insured depository institutions (institutions) that result in a\nnational bank or Federal savings association.1 Under the BMA, the OCC must consider\nthe following factors: competition; the financial and managerial resources and future\nprospects of the existing and proposed institutions; the convenience and needs of the\ncommunity to be served; the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial\nsystem; and the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in combatting\nmoney laundering activities, including in overseas branches.2 The BMA generally\nrequires public notice of the transaction to be published for 30 days.3 OCC regulations\nrequire the public notice to include essential details about the transaction and instructions\nfor public comment. The regulations incorporate the statutory 30-day public notice period\nand provide a 30-day public comment period, which the OCC may extend.4 The OCC\nmay also hold a public hearing, public meeting, or private meeting on an application.5\nOn September 25, 2024, the OCC published in the Federal Register6 a final rule\n(2024 Final Rule) removing the expedited review procedures contained in \u00a7 5.33(i) and\nthe streamlined application form in \u00a7 5.33(j). The final rule also added as an appendix to\n1 A business combination for these purposes includes an assumption of deposits in addition to a merger or\nconsolidation.\n2 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(5), (11).\n3 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(4).\n4 12 CFR 5.8(b), 5.10(b)(1).\n5 12 CFR 5.11.\n6 89 FR 78207 (Sept. 25, 2024).\n4 12 CFR part 5, subpart C, a policy statement that discussed both the general principles\nthe agency uses to review applications under the BMA and how it considers financial\nstability, financial and managerial resources and future prospects, and convenience and\nneeds factors. The policy statement also described criteria informing the OCC\u2019s decision\non whether to extend the public comment period and whether to hold a public meeting on\nan application subject to the BMA. The final rule and policy statement became effective\non January 1, 2025.\nThe OCC is issuing this interim final rule to reduce the burden and uncertainty\nthat the 2024 Final Rule added to the application process. The interim final rule rescinds\nthe changes made by the 2024 Final Rule, restoring the expedited review procedures in \u00a7\n5.33(i) and the streamlined application form in \u00a7 5.33(j) and removing the appendix\ncontaining the policy statement.\nII. Description of the Interim Final Rule\nRegulatory Amendments\nPrior to the 2024 Final Rule, \u00a7 5.33(i) provided that a filing that qualifies either as\na business reorganization as defined in \u00a7 5.33(d)(3) or for a streamlined application under\n\u00a7 5.33(j) is deemed approved as of the 15th day after the close of the comment period,\nunless the OCC notifies the applicant that the filing is not eligible for expedited review or\nthe expedited review process is extended under \u00a7 5.13(a)(2). Twelve CFR 5.33(j)\nauthorized the use of a streamlined application if: (i) at least one party to the transaction\nis an eligible bank or eligible savings association, and all other parties to the transaction\nare eligible banks, eligible savings associations, or eligible depository institutions; the\nresulting national bank or resulting Federal savings association will be well capitalized\n5 immediately following consummation of the transaction; and the total assets of the target\ninstitution are no more than 50 percent of the total assets of the acquiring bank or Federal\nsavings association, as reported in each institution\u2019s Consolidated Report of Condition\nand Income filed for the quarter immediately preceding the filing of the application; (ii)\nthe acquiring bank or Federal savings association is an eligible bank or eligible savings\nassociation; the target bank or savings association is not an eligible bank, eligible savings\nassociation, or an eligible depository institution; the resulting national bank or resulting\nFederal savings association will be well capitalized immediately following\nconsummation of the transaction; and the filers in a prefiling communication request and\nobtain approval from the appropriate OCC licensing office to use the streamlined\napplication; (iii) the acquiring bank or Federal savings association is an eligible bank or\neligible savings association; the target bank or savings association is not an eligible bank,\neligible savings association, or an eligible depository institution; the resulting bank or\nresulting Federal savings association will be well capitalized immediately following\nconsummation of the transaction; and the total assets acquired do not exceed 10 percent\nof the total assets of the acquiring national bank or acquiring Federal savings association,\nas reported in each institution\u2019s Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed for\nthe quarter immediately preceding the filing of the application; or (iv) in the case of a\ntransaction under 12 CFR 5.33(g)(4), the acquiring bank is an eligible bank; the resulting\nnational bank will be well capitalized immediately following consummation of the\ntransaction; the filers in a prefiling communication request and obtain approval from the\nappropriate OCC licensing office to use the streamlined application; and the total assets\nacquired do not exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the acquiring national bank, as\n6 reported in the bank\u2019s Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed for the quarter\nimmediately preceding the filing of the application. The streamlined application\nrequested information about topics similar to those addressed in the Interagency Bank\nMerger Act Application, but the former only required an applicant to provide detailed\ninformation if the applicant answered in the affirmative to any one of a series of yes or no\nquestions.\nThe OCC recognizes the additional burden that use of the Interagency Bank\nMerger Act Application places on applicants that formerly qualified to use the\nstreamlined application. Additionally, as noted in the original adoption of the expedited\nreview process, \u201cmany types of applications submitted by healthy banks whose\napplications should entail low levels of risk\u201d support the OCC\u2019s \u201ccalibrat[ion of] the\nextent of regulatory review an application receives to focus more resources on\napplications that are novel, are complex, or present potentially greater risk to the\napplicant bank.\u201d7 Ensuring the timely and efficient processing of merger applications,\nincluding through expedited review, would help facilitate economic growth and\ninnovation.\nFor the reasons discussed above, the interim final rule restores without change\n\u00a7 5.33(i) and (j) that were removed by the 2024 Final Rule. The 2024 Final Rule also\nremoved the term \u201cbusiness reorganization,\u201d which was defined in \u00a7 5.33(d)(3) as a\nbusiness combination between eligible banks and eligible savings associations, or\nbetween an eligible bank or an eligible savings association and an eligible depository\n7 61 FR 60342 (Nov. 27, 1996).\n7 institution,8 that are controlled by the same holding company or that will be controlled by\nthe same holding company prior to the combination; or a business combination between\nan eligible bank or an eligible savings association and an interim national bank or interim\nFederal savings association chartered in a transaction in which a person or group of\npersons exchanges its shares of the eligible bank or eligible savings association for shares\nof a newly formed holding company and receives after the transaction substantially the\nsame proportional share interest in the holding company as it held in the eligible bank or\neligible savings association (except for changes in interests resulting from the exercise of\ndissenters\u2019 rights), and the reorganization involves no other transactions involving the\nbank or savings association. As this definition is used to define one of the classes of\napplications eligible for expedited review under \u00a7 5.33(i), the interim final rule also\nrestores without change \u00a7 5.33(d)(3) that was removed by the 2024 Final Rule.\nPolicy Statement\nIn issuing the Policy Statement as part of the 2024 Final Rule, the OCC\u2019s stated\npurpose was increasing the transparency and clarity for the public about the OCC\u2019s\nreview of applications under the Bank Merger Act.9 The Policy Statement contains three\nmain areas of discussion: (1) general principles of OCC review; (2) the financial stability,\nfinancial and managerial resources and future prospects, and convenience and needs\nfactors under the BMA; and (3) the public comment period and public meetings.\n8 \u201cEligible bank,\u201d \u201celigible savings association,\u201d and \u201celigible depository institution\u201d are defined in 12 CFR\n5.3. An institution meets the appropriate definition if it is well capitalized; has a composite rating of 1 or 2;\nhas a Community Reinvestment Act rating of \u201cOutstanding\u201d or \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d if applicable; has a\nconsumer compliance rating of 1 or 2; and is not subject to a cease and desist order, consent order, formal\nwritten agreement, or Prompt Corrective Action directive, or is notified in writing by the OCC that it may\nbe treated as an \u201celigible bank or eligible savings association\u201d if subject to any such order, agreement, or\ndirective.\n9 See, e.g., 89 FR 78207.\n8 However, the OCC is aware that the release of the Policy Statement generated confusion\nand generally did not succeed in providing additional clarity to banks or the public.\nFurther, the banking industry may be unwilling to engage in economically beneficial\nmergers in light of the confusion and uncertainty caused by the Policy Statement. After\nfurther consideration, the OCC believes that rescinding the Policy Statement will\nexpedite the OCC\u2019s review of business combination applications and decrease\nuncertainty for both the banking industry and the public. The OCC will consider issuing a\nnew policy statement after reviewing any comments submitted in response to this interim\nfinal rule.\nThe OCC believes that the general principles of OCC review are sufficiently\ncaptured in the policies underlying the restored streamlined application and expedited\nreview, discussed above as well as in the Comptroller\u2019s Licensing Manual, \u201cBusiness\nCombinations\u201d booklet. These procedures have existed for nearly thirty years, and the\nbanking industry and public are familiar with how the OCC handles applications under\nthese procedures. The OCC\u2019s goal is to encourage economically beneficial mergers to\nsupport the United States economy and innovation. Rescission of the policy statement\nsupports these goals by removing the outstanding confusion and uncertainty. The OCC\nwill consider any future changes to these procedures in response to comments on the\ninterim final rule and developments in the banking industry. Similarly, the BMA\u2019s\nstatutory factors have existed in their current form since 2011 with the majority of those\nfactors in their current form since 1966. To the extent that more specific guidance on the\nstatutory factors is needed, the OCC will consider any comments it receives in response\nto this interim final rule.\n9 The discussion of public comments and public meetings in the Policy Statement is\nlargely duplicative of the regulatory provisions in 12 CFR 5.10 and 5.11. Accordingly,\nthe OCC believes that these regulations provide sufficient information to the banking\nindustry and public to support rescission of the public comments and meetings portion of\nthe Policy Statement.\nAccordingly, the OCC is rescinding the Policy Statement, effective upon\npublication of this interim final rule in the Federal Register. The OCC requests comment\non what content would be helpful in any future policy statement discussing the OCC\u2019s\nreview of applications under the BMA. The OCC is committed to providing transparent\nand useful information to the banking industry and the public to facilitate beneficial\nmergers that increase and support economic activity and innovation in the economy.\nIV. Regulatory Analysis\nA. Administrative Law Matters\nThe OCC is issuing the interim final rule without prior notice and the opportunity\nfor public comment and the delayed effective date ordinarily prescribed by the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA).10 Pursuant to section 553(b)(B) of the APA,\ngeneral notice and the opportunity for public comment are not required with respect to a\nrulemaking when an \u201cagency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a\nbrief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure\nthereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\u201d\nThe OCC believes that the public interest is best served by the immediate\neffectiveness of the interim final rule upon publication in the Federal Register. As\n10 5 U.S.C. 553.\n10 discussed above, there has been significant confusion in the banking industry and public\nabout the effect of the 2024 Final Rule, potentially hampering economically beneficial\nbank mergers. Similarly, reducing burden by reinstating the streamlined application and\nexpedited review will encourage bank mergers beneficial to the United States economy\nand innovation.\nThe APA also requires a 30-day delayed effective date, except for (1) substantive\nrules which grant or recognize an exemption or relieve a restriction; (2) interpretative\nrules and statements of policy; or (3) as otherwise provided by the agency for good\ncause.11 The interim final rule grants exemptions from use of the Interagency Bank\nMerger Act form through allowing use of the streamlined application and grants relief\nfrom ordinary processing procedures by reinstating expedited review. Further, the interim\nfinal rule rescinds the policy statement. Accordingly, the OCC finds good cause exists to\nencourage economically beneficial bank mergers and reduce burden. As such, the interim\nfinal rule is exempt from the APA\u2019s delayed effective date requirement.\nWhile the OCC believes that there is good cause to issue the interim final rule\nwithout advance notice and comment and with an immediate effective date, the agency is\ninterested in the views of the public and requests comment on all aspects of the interim\nfinal rule.\nB. Paperwork Reduction Act\nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA),12 the OCC may not conduct or\nsponsor, and a respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless\nit displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number.\n11 5 U.S.C. 553(d).\n12 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521.\n11 The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted to\nOMB under OMB control number 1557-0014 (Licensing Manual).\nThis interim final rule amends 12 CFR 5.33 by restoring the expedited review\nprocedures in \u00a7 5.33(i), which will allow an application to be deemed approved by the\nOCC as of the 15th day after the close of the comment period, unless the OCC notifies\nthe filer that the filing is not eligible for expedited review or the expedited review process\nis extended. This interim final rule restores the streamlined application in \u00a7 5.33(j), which\npermits the ability of eligible institutions to file for certain types of business\ncombinations using a streamlined application form.\nTitle: Licensing Manual.\nOMB control number: 1557-0014.\nFrequency of Response: Occasional.\nAffected Public: National banks and Federal savings associations.\nThe changes to the burden of the Licensing Manual are de minis and continue to be:\nEstimated Number of Respondents: 3,694.\nEstimated Total Annual Burden: 12,481.15.\nC. Regulatory Flexibility Act\nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)13 requires an agency to consider whether\nthe rules it proposes will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of\nsmall entities (defined by the Small Business Administration for purposes of the RFA to\ninclude commercial banks and savings institutions with total assets of $850 million or\nless and trust companies with total assets of $47 million or less). The RFA applies to\n13 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.\n12 rules for which an agency publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to\n5 U.S.C. 553(b). Consistent with section 553(b)(B) of the APA, the OCC has determined\nfor good cause that general notice and opportunity for public comment is unnecessary,\nand therefore the OCC is not issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, the\nOCC has concluded that the RFA\u2019s requirements relating to initial and final regulatory\nflexibility analysis do not apply.\nAs discussed in the 2024 Final Rule, the OCC expected the changes made by the\n2024 Final Rule to have a de minimis impact on small entities.14 Accordingly, the OCC\nbelieves that rescission of the 2024 Final Rule would likely have a de minimis impact on\nsmall entities. Nevertheless, the OCC seeks comment on whether, and the extent to\nwhich, the interim final rule would affect a significant number of small entities.\nD. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\nAs a general matter, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA)15\nrequires that the preparation of a budgetary impact statement before promulgating a rule\nthat includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and\nTribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more\n(adjusted annually for inflation, currently $187 million) in any one year. However, the\nUMRA does not apply to final rules for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking\nwas not published.16 Therefore, because the OCC has found good cause to dispense with\nnotice and comment for this interim final rule, the OCC has not prepared an economic\nanalysis of the rule under the UMRA.\n14 89 FR 78217.\n15 2 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.\n16 See 2 U.S.C. 1532(a).\n13 As discussed in the 2024 Final Rule, the OCC estimated that the annual aggregate\ncost of the final rule once fully phased in will be de minimis.17 Accordingly, the OCC\nbelieves that the interim final rule will not likely result in an expenditure of $187 million\nor more annually by State, local, and Tribal governments or by the private sector.\nE. Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994\nPursuant to section 302(a) of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory\nImprovement Act (RCDRIA) of 1994,18 in determining the effective date and\nadministrative compliance requirements for new regulations that impose additional\nreporting, disclosure, or other requirements on insured depository institutions, the OCC\nmust consider, consistent with principles of safety and soundness and the public interest\n(1) any administrative burdens that the final rule would place on depository institutions,\nincluding small depository institutions and customers of depository institutions and (2)\nthe benefits of the final rule. In addition, section 302(b) of RCDRIA requires new\nregulations and amendments to regulations that impose additional reporting, disclosures,\nor other new requirements on insured depository institutions generally to take effect on\nthe first day of a calendar quarter that begins on or after the date on which the regulations\nare published in final form, unless the agency determines, for good cause published with\nthe regulation, that the regulation should become effective before such time.19 As the\ninterim final rule relieves, rather than imposes, reporting and other requirements, the\ndelayed effective date provisions of section 302(b) of RCDRIA are inapplicable. Further,\n17 89 FR 78217-78218.\n18 12 U.S.C. 4802(a).\n19 12 U.S.C. 4802(b)(1)(A).\n14 for the reasons discussed above, the OCC finds good cause exists to publish the interim\nfinal rule with an immediate effective date.\nAs such, the interim final rule will be effective immediately. Nevertheless, the OCC\nseeks comment on RCDRIA.\nF. Executive Order 14192\nThe OCC has determined that the interim final rule is not a significant regulatory action\nor a significant guidance document for purposes of Executive Order 14192.\nG. Congressional Review Act\nFor purposes of the Congressional Review Act, the Office of Management and\nBudget (OMB) makes a determination as to whether a final rule constitutes a \u201cmajor\nrule.\u201d20 If a rule is deemed a \u201cmajor rule\u201d by the OMB, the Congressional Review Act\ngenerally provides that the rule may not take effect until at least 60 days following its\npublication.21\nThe Congressional Review Act defines a \u201cmajor rule\u201d as any rule that the\nAdministrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the OMB finds has\nresulted in or is likely to result in: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000\nor more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,\nFederal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant\nadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on\nthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in\ndomestic and export markets.22\n20 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.\n21 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(3).\n22 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\n15 The delayed effective date required by the Congressional Review Act does not\napply to any rule for which the agency determines and for good cause finds (and\nincorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rule issued) that\nnotice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the\npublic interest.23 For the reasons discussed above, the OCC finds good cause that\ndelaying the effective date would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest.\nAs required by the Congressional Review Act, the OCC will submit the interim\nfinal rule and other appropriate reports to Congress and the Government Accountability\nOffice for review.\nList of Subjects\n12 CFR Part 5\nAdministrative practice and procedure, National banks, Reporting and\nrecordkeeping requirements, Savings associations, Securities.\nFor the reasons set forth in the preamble, the OCC amends chapter I of title 12 of\nthe Code of Federal Regulations as follows:\nPART 5\u2014RULES, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES FOR CORPORATE\nACTIVITIES\n1. The authority citation for part 5 continues to read as follows:\nAuthority: 12 U.S.C. 1 et seq., 24a, 35, 93a, 214a, 215, 215a, 215a\u20131, 215a\u20132,\n215a\u20133, 215c, 371d, 481, 1462a, 1463, 1464, 1817(j), 1831i, 1831u, 2901 et seq., 3101 et\nseq., 3907, and 5412(b)(2)(B).\n23 5 U.S.C. 808(2).\n16 \u00a7 5.33 [Amended]\n2.

    "cleaned_text":"Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood\nRemarks at the Building Societies Annual Conference\nBirmingham, England\nMay 8, 2025\nThank you for inviting me to participate in this august event, the Building Societies\nAnnual Conference. I previously had the honor of addressing this audience, but in a prior\ncapacity as the Chairman of the National Credit Union Association. It is an absolute pleasure to\nvisit with you in Birmingham today as the Acting Comptroller of the Currency, and to enjoy a\nrobust dialogue about issues of our common history and interest.\nThis year, you are celebrating the 250th anniversary of the world\u2019s first known building\nsociety. Founded by Richard Ketley, the proprietor of the former Golden Cross Inn here in\nBirmingham, the industrial revolution was taking off and skilled metal workers in the city were\nseeking to buy homes.\nIn that year of 1775, Mr. Ketley started his own revolution, as we Americans might say.\nBut rather than seeking formal independence as was the focus at the time in the United States, his\ninnovation was to bring together groups of neighbors and friends who knew and trusted each\nother to pool their funds and lend money to their fellow members seeking houses.\nLike the English industrial revolution, the Ketley experiment eventually crossed the\nAtlantic Ocean. An American scholar named David Mason\u2014appropriately, an English word for\nbuilder\u2014wrote that in January 1831 \u201cforty-five men in the \u2026 Philadelphia area \u2026 formed the\nOxford Provident Building Association, the first savings and loan association in the United States. Because many of these organizers came from the English Midlands and were familiar\nwith building societies, the operating plan of their new financial institution closely resembled\nthat of its English counterparts.\u201d\nMason noted that the \u201cbuilding society movement was the first effort to help people not\nin the upper classes become homeowners.\u201d The effort started in the middle class, then spread to\nthe working class, and later to specific groups of all kinds. Mason said it was \u201ccommon for\nbuilding societies to admit both men and women as members and treat them as equals.\u201d\nToday, of course, we recognize this as the very definition of \u201cfinancial inclusion.\u201d I am\npleased to note that such inclusion extends far and wide across this great room\u2014and indeed\nacross the great ocean. It also is an area of my personal focus in the United States.\nCreated by President Abraham Lincoln 162 years ago, the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) regulates more than 1,000 national banks and federal savings associations\nand supervises and licenses the federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. These\ninstitutions collectively are responsible for more than $16 trillion in assets, representing\napproximately two-thirds of all U.S. banking assets, and reflect a variety of business models. Our\nmission is to ensure that each of these institutions operates in a safe and sound manner, provides\nfair access to financial services, treats customers fairly, and complies with applicable laws and\nregulations. The institutions we supervise range from the largest publicly traded global, corporate\nstock institutions to smaller member-owned mutual institutions. And every single one of these\ninstitutions has an opportunity\u2014indeed I would call it an imperative\u2014to advance the objectives\nof financial inclusion and to positively affect unbanked and underbanked individuals by bringing\nthem into the banking mainstream.\n2 Since arriving at the OCC in February, I have focused on four specific priority areas. This\nincludes reducing regulatory burden to ensure that regulations are effective and not excessive so\nthat the institutions we supervise can thrive and innovate. It also includes embracing bank-\nfintech partnerships because innovation is not optional, but essential. When deployed\nresponsibly, financial technology can broaden access, enhance efficiency, and deepen\nrelationships between banks and their customers. I\u2019m also focused on expanding responsible\nbank activities involving digital assets to support the 50 million Americans who now hold some\nform of cryptocurrency. Regulated banks must keep up with this transformation. Lastly, and near\nand dear to my heart as evidenced by my more than 30 years of service in the financial industry,\nis my focus on promoting financial inclusion.\nI have often said\u2014and continue to believe\u2014that financial inclusion is the civil rights\nissue of our time. Consider the 40 percent of American households that cannot cover a $400\nemergency expense, or the nearly 70 million individuals in the U.S. who are credit invisible.\nWithout access to fair and affordable financial services, they remain vulnerable to predatory\nlenders, to economic shocks, and to exclusion from opportunity.\nI view financial inclusion as more than just a regulatory objective, but as a cornerstone of\neconomic empowerment. Access to banking provides an important on-ramp to engage in the\neconomy. It ensures that individuals and communities have access to the financial tools and\nresources necessary to build wealth, invest in education, start businesses, and, importantly,\nachieve homeownership. Homeownership, as many of you know, is not merely about possessing\nproperty; it is about establishing roots, fostering community, attaining financial stability, and\ncreating opportunities for generational wealth.\n3 Generational wealth, such as the assets passed down from one generation to the next,\nplays a pivotal role in breaking the cycle of poverty and building economic resilience.\nHomeownership has historically been one of the most effective vehicles for accumulating and\ntransferring such wealth. However, systemic barriers have long prevented many underserved\ncommunities from accessing homeownership opportunities, thereby hindering their ability to\nbuild and sustain wealth over generations.\nRecognizing these challenges, the OCC launched Project REACh\u2014or the Roundtable for\nEconomic Access and Change\u2014in July 2020. This initiative convenes leaders from banking,\nbusiness, technology, and community organizations to identify and reduce barriers that prevent\nunderserved communities from fully participating in our economy. Through collaborative efforts,\nProject REACh aims to dismantle systemic barriers and promote innovative solutions that\nadvance financial inclusion.\nToday, Project REACh participants are supporting financial inclusion in several ways.\nFor example, successful pilot projects have proven that expanding the availability of credit by\nextending consumer loans to customers with thin- and no-credit files by using transaction data\nrather than credit scores opens the financial system to consumers who were previously credit\ninvisible.\nAnother one of the critical areas of focus for Project REACh is affordable\nhomeownership. By addressing the challenges that disadvantaged and underserved consumers\nface in buying homes, and by encouraging the development of innovative products and services\nthat improve access to credit, we strive to make homeownership attainable. This endeavor is not\njust about increasing homeownership rates; it is about ensuring that the dream of owning a home,\n4 and the associated benefits of stability and wealth creation, is accessible to every individual,\nregardless of their background or economic status.\nI am pleased to report that Project REACh participants are working to expand affordable\nhomeownership through down payment assistance programs, special-purpose credit programs,\nand innovative mortgage products tailored to help first-time homebuyers. Additionally, member\norganizations are enhancing homebuyer counseling so that prospective homeowners can\nsuccessfully navigate the home buying process. By fostering meaningful partnerships and\nencouraging creative problem-solving, Project REACh can empower more Americans to achieve\nhomeownership and build generational wealth.\nTechnology can also be a significant enabler in expanding financial access and\nopportunity. Responsible innovation in financial technology can deliver to consumers useful\nfinancial products in ways that are safe, sound, and cost-efficient. Engaging with innovative\ntechnology players will help to build the financial system that we want and need.\nMany consumers rely on digital financial services to manage their financial lives. I have\nbeen encouraging banks to think about how we could use the power of these tools to expand\nfinancial inclusion and improve consumer financial health.\nAs mentioned previously, we know that millions of Americans are investing in digital\nassets. I want to enable that activity to occur within the federal banking system according to a\nsafe and sound framework. The OCC recently reaffirmed that a range of cryptocurrency\nactivities are permissible by the institutions we supervise. We expect banks to have the same\nstrong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for\ntraditional ones.\n5 While I am new to the OCC, I am not new to this arena. I have spent my career working\nin financial services and promoting community development and financial inclusion. I\u2019m\ndedicated to serving the American people and the national banking system by fostering a\nregulatory structure that encourages innovation and financial inclusion.\nAs we celebrate 250 years of building societies, it is worth emphasizing that banks,\nbuilding societies, and cooperative financial institutions share a common calling: to expand\neconomic opportunity, foster trust, and build stronger, more inclusive communities. Working\ntogether, we can ensure that the values which shaped our founding\u2014collaboration, mutual\nbenefit, and a spirit of service\u2014remain vibrant and effective for the next 250 years.\nI would also like to take a moment to recognize and applaud Robin Fieth, the long-\nserving CEO of the Building Societies Association, on his approaching retirement. Robin and I\nfirst met during a virtual conference at the height of the pandemic, and we have been friends and\ncolleagues in this shared journey toward financial inclusion ever since. Robin, your leadership,\nwisdom, and unwavering commitment to mutuality and community banking have left a legacy\nnot just here in the United Kingdom, but around the world.\nThank you again for inviting me to join this historic celebration and to reaffirm the\nenduring relationship between our two great nations. In the spirit of that friendship, I close with\nthe words attributed to Sir Winston Churchill, who once said:\n\u201cTo each, there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively\ntapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do something truly special, unique to\ntheir talents and calling.\u201d\n6 Building societies, banks, cooperatives\u2014all of us gathered here today\u2014have that\nopportunity. Let us seize it boldly, together.\n7",

The letter concluded that banks may provide crypto-asset custody services in a\nfiduciary or non-fiduciary capacity under applicable statutory authority.1 Providing crypto-asset\ncustody services is a modern form of traditional bank custody activities.2 The letter\nacknowledged that banks may use sub-custodians for crypto-asset custody and provided\nexamples of the types of services that banks may offer as custodians. Specifically, footnote 39 of\nInterpretive Letter 1170 stated:\nThe services national banks may provide in relation to the cryptocurrency they are\ncustodying may include services such as facilitating the customer\u2019s cryptocurrency\nand fiat currency exchange transactions, transaction settlement, trade execution,\n[recordkeeping], valuation, tax services, reporting, or other appropriate services.

    "cleaned_text":"Interpretive Letter #1170\nJuly 22, 2020 July 2020\nRe: Authority of a National Bank to Provide Cryptocurrency Custody Services for Customers\nDear [ ],\nI. Introduction and Summary Conclusion\nThis letter responds to your request regarding the authority of a national bank to provide\ncryptocurrency custody services for customers. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude a\nnational bank may provide these cryptocurrency custody services on behalf of customers,\nincluding by holding the unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency.1 This letter\nalso reaffirms the OCC\u2019s position that national banks may provide permissible banking services\nto any lawful business they choose, including cryptocurrency businesses, so long as they\neffectively manage the risks and comply with applicable law.2\nII. Background\nCryptocurrencies\u2014also known as \u201cdigital currencies\u201d or \u201cvirtual currencies\u201d\u2014are\ndesigned to work as a medium of exchange and are created and stored electronically.3\nDepending on the type of cryptocurrency, it may have characteristics of either fiat money or\nmoney backed by some underlying asset(s) or claim(s). Fiat money refers to instruments that do\nnot have intrinsic value but that individuals and institutions are willing to use for purposes of\npurchase and investment because they are issued by a government. Government-issued\ncurrencies, including the U.S. dollar following abandonment of the gold standard, are traditional\nfiat money. Some types of cryptocurrencies may have similar characteristics as fiat money\n1 As discussed further below, this conclusion also applies to Federal savings associations (FSAs).\n2 Banks determine the levels and types of risks that they will assume. Banks that operate in compliance with\napplicable law, properly manage customer relationships and effectively mitigate risks by implementing controls\ncommensurate with those risks are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services. As the\nfederal banking agencies have previously stated, banks are encouraged to manage customer relationships and\nmitigate risks based on customer relationships rather than declining to provide banking services to entire categories\nof customers. See Joint Statement on Risk-Focused Bank Secrecy Act\/Anti-Money Laundering Supervision, at 2\n(July 22, 2019), available at https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/news-issuances\/news-releases\/2019\/nr-ia-2019-81a.pdf.\n3 The term \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d as used in this letter also encompasses digital assets that are not broadly used as\ncurrencies. because they are not backed by any other assets. Other types of money may be backed by assets\n(such as a commodity). The U.S. dollar was a type of asset-backed money prior to abandonment\nof the gold standard. Some types of cryptocurrencies may have similar characteristics to this\ntype of money. For example, stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is backed by an asset,\nsuch as a fiat currency or a commodity.\nWhile cryptocurrency shares certain characteristics of these traditional types of money,\nthe exchange mechanism is novel. The exchange mechanism for most cryptocurrencies is based\non two separate underlying technologies. The first is advanced cryptography, which is used to\nprotect information related to the cryptocurrency. Cryptography allows the creation of digital\ncode that generally cannot be altered without the permission of the creator.\nThe second type of technology underlying cryptocurrencies\u2019 exchange mechanism is\nknown as \u201cdistributed ledger technology,\u201d and consists of a shared electronic database where\ncopies of the same information are stored on multiple computers. This shared database functions\nas both a mechanism to prevent tampering and as a way to add new information to the database.\nInformation will not be added to the distributed ledger until consensus is reached that the\ninformation is valid. Furthermore, attempts to change the information on one computer will not\nimpact the information on the other computers. Some distributed ledgers are known as\n\u201cblockchains\u201d because the transactions stored on the ledger are sequentially grouped together in\nblocks, thus creating a chronological record of all transactions to that point.4\nCryptocurrencies do not exist in any physical form. They exist only on the distributed\nledger on which they are recorded. A particular unit of cryptocurrency is assigned to a party\nthrough the use of a set of unique cryptographic keys. Those keys allow that party to transfer the\ncryptocurrency to another party.5 If those keys are lost, a party will generally be unable to access\nits cryptocurrency. Furthermore, if a third party gains access to those keys, that third party can\nuse the keys to transfer the cryptocurrency to themselves.\nThe first widely-adopted cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was introduced in 2008.6 Since the\ncreation of Bitcoin, hundreds of additional virtual currencies have been created, all of which\nhave different characteristics and potential uses.

The Proposed Activities\nThe bank has proposed to offer cryptocurrency custody services to its customers as part\nof its existing custody business. We understand that there is a growing demand for safe places,\nsuch as banks,16 to hold unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrencies on behalf of\ncustomers and to provide related custody services.17 These services are in demand for several\nreasons. First, because the underlying keys to a unit of cryptocurrency are essentially\nirreplaceable if lost, owners may lose access to their cryptocurrencies as a result of misplacing\ntheir keys, resulting in significant losses of value.18 Second, banks may offer more secure\n13 Numerous states have adopted or proposed legislation that relates to cryptocurrency, usually exempting digital\ncurrencies from money transmitter licensing requirements and securities laws or recognizing that records secured\nthrough blockchain technology have the same legal status as written records.

At least one\nstate has passed legislation and promulgated regulations allowing state-chartered banks to opt-in to providing\ncustody services for digital assets. See, e.g., Wyo. Admin. Code 021.0002.19. These regulations were promulgated\npursuant to Wyoming Statute (\u201cW.S.\u201d) 34-29-104, Digital asset custodial services. Under W.S. 34-29-104, banks\nthat elect to provide digital asset custodial services must comply with all provision of W.S. 34-29-104 and the new\nregulations (known as the enhanced digital custody opt-in regime). The states of Hawaii and Rhode Island have also\nrecently proposed legislation on digital asset custody. See Hawaii SB2594 (introduced Jan. 17, 2020), available at\nhttps:\/\/www.capitol.hawaii.gov\/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&billnumber=2594&year=2020; Rhode Island\nHB7989, available at https:\/\/legiscan.com\/RI\/bill\/H7989\/2020 (introduced Mar. 11, 2020).\n17 See, e.g., Melanie Kramer, Will Cryptocurrency Custody Services Fuel Institutional Demand?, Bitcoinist.com\n(July 22, 2018), https:\/\/bitcoinist.com\/crypto-custody-services-fuel-institutional-demand\/ (describing how\ninstitutional investors may feel more comfortable maintaining cryptocurrencies in the custody of banks than\nexchanges).\n18 One empirical analysis of the bitcoin blockchain calculated that roughly 20% of all currently outstanding bitcoin\nhave been lost.

Cryptocurrencies are generally held in \u201cwallets,\u201d which are programs that\nstore the cryptographic keys associated with a particular unit of digital currency. Because digital\ncurrencies exist only on the blockchain or distributed ledger on which they are stored, there is no\nphysical possession of the instrument. Instead, the right to a particular unit of digital currency is\ntransferred from party to party by the use of unique cryptographic keys. Therefore, a bank\n\u201cholding\u201d digital currencies on behalf of a customer is actually taking possession of the\ncryptographic access keys to that unit of cryptocurrency. Those keys are held in a \u201cwallet\u201d that\nprotects the keys from discovery by a third party.20 Keys can be stored in \u201chot\u201d wallets or \u201ccold\u201d\nwallets. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, which makes them convenient to access but\nmore susceptible to hacking. Cold wallets are physical devices that are completely offline (for\nexample, paper or hardware wallets that can be stored in a physical vault). Currently, cold\nstorage is considered the most secure method of storing cryptographic keys.21\nThe OCC recognizes that, as the financial markets become increasingly technological,\nthere will likely be increasing need for banks and other service providers to leverage new\ntechnology and innovative ways to provide traditional services on behalf of customers. By\nproviding such services, banks can continue to fulfill the financial intermediation function they\nhave historically played in providing payment, loan and deposit services. Through intermediated\nexchanges of payments, banks facilitate the flow of funds within our economy and serve\nimportant financial risk management and other financial needs of bank customers.22\nbad-news-you-forgot-your-password-1513701480 (reporting numerous examples of individuals losing access to\nsignificant value in bitcoin as a result of lost passwords).\n19 Some cryptocurrency exchanges that store access to cryptocurrency on behalf of customers have proven\nvulnerable to hacking and theft.

Discussion\nNational banks have long provided safekeeping and custody services for a wide variety of\ncustomer assets, including both physical objects and electronic assets. These functions of\nnational banks are well established and extensively recognized as permissible activities for\nnational banks.23 The OCC concludes, for the reasons discussed below, that providing\ncryptocurrency custody services, including holding the unique cryptographic keys associated\nwith cryptocurrency, is a modern form of these traditional bank activities.\nSafekeeping services are among the most fundamental and basic services provided by\nbanks.24 Bank customers traditionally used special deposit and safe deposit boxes for the storage\nand safekeeping of a variety of physical objects, such as valuable papers, rare coins, and\njewelry.25 As the banking industry entered the digital age, the OCC recognized the\npermissibility of electronic safekeeping activities. Specifically, the OCC has concluded that a\nnational bank may escrow encryption keys used in connection with digital certificates,26 finding\nthat the key escrow service is a functional equivalent to physical safekeeping, except it uses\nelectronic technology suitable to the digital nature of the item to be kept safe. The OCC has also\nconcluded that a national bank may provide secure web-based document storage, retrieval and\ncollaboration of documents and files containing personal information or valuable confidential\ntrade or business information because these services are the electronic expression of traditional\nsafekeeping services provided by banks.27 The OCC codified these interpretive rulings in\n12 CFR Part 7.28\nTraditional bank custodians frequently offer a range of services in addition to simple\nsafekeeping of assets. For example, a custodian providing core domestic custody services for\n23 See OCC Conditional Approval 479 (July 27, 2001) (Conditional Approval 479). \u201cSafekeeping\u201d implies the\nbasic service of a bank holding on to an asset for a customer (e.g., gold or securities). \u201cCustody\u201d is a broader term\nthat may involve all aspects of bank services performed for customers in relation to items they are holding for them\n(i.e., processing, settlement, fund administration). Historically, banks only offered safekeeping services, which then\nevolved into banks providing custodial services to their customers. See Comptroller\u2019s Handbooks on Custody\nServices (Jan. 2002) (Custody Handbook).\n24 Colorado Nat. Bank of Denver v. Bedford, 310 U.S. 41, 50 (1940) (finding that providing safe deposit boxes is\n\u201csuch a generally adopted method of safeguarding valuables [that it] must be considered a banking function\nauthorized by Congress\u201d under the National Bank Act). The safekeeping of valuable personal property is a\ntraditional function that banks have performed since the earliest times. \u201cOriginally the business of banking\nconsisted only in receiving deposits, such as bullion, plate and the like for safe-keeping until the depositor should\nsee fit to draw it out for use. . . .\u201d Oulton v.

City of Portland, 157 Ore. 203, 69 P.2d 273 (1937).\n25 See Conditional Approval 479; Comptroller\u2019s Handbook on Custody Services (Custody Handbook) (Jan. 2002) at\npage 15 (jewelry listed as one of the miscellaneous assets that banks hold via on-premises custody).\n26 See OCC Conditional Approval 267 (Jan. 12, 1998) (Conditional Approval 267).\n27 See Conditional Approval 479.\n28 See 12 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 7.5002(a)(4) and 7.5005(a).\n6 securities typically settles trades, invests cash balances as directed, collects income, processes\ncorporate actions, prices securities positions, and provides recordkeeping and reporting\nservices.29 It is well-established that national banks may provide custody services to their\ncustomers in either a fiduciary or non-fiduciary capacity. 12 U.S.C. 92a expressly authorizes the\nOCC to grant fiduciary powers to national banks.30 National banks may also provide non-\nfiduciary custody services to their customers.31 The OCC has determined national banks may act\nas non-fiduciary custodians pursuant to the business of banking and their incidental powers.32\nOCC guidance has recognized that banks may hold a wide variety of assets as custodians,\nincluding assets that are unique and hard to value.33 These custody activities often include assets\nthat transfer electronically.34 The OCC generally has not prohibited banks from providing\ncustody services for any particular type of asset, as long as the bank has the capability to hold the\nasset and the assets are not illegal in the jurisdiction where they will be held.35\nProviding custody services for cryptocurrency falls within these longstanding authorities\nto engage in safekeeping and custody activities. As discussed below, this is a permissible form\nof a traditional banking activity that national banks are authorized to perform via electronic\n29 See Custody Handbook at 2.\n30 \u201cThe Comptroller of the Currency shall be authorized and empowered to grant by special permit to national banks\napplying therefor, when not in contravention of State or local law, the right to act as trustee, executor, administrator,\nregistrar of stocks and bonds, guardian of estates, assignee, receiver, or in any other fiduciary capacity in which\nState banks, trust companies, or other corporations which come into competition with national banks are permitted\nto act under the laws of the State in which the national bank is located.\u201d 12 U.S.C. 92a(a). 12 CFR Part 9\nimplements 12 U.S.C. 92a. The fiduciary capacities defined under Part 9 are \u201ctrustee, executor, administrator,\nregistrar of stocks and bonds, transfer agent, guardian, assignee, receiver, or custodian under a uniform gifts to\nminors act; investment adviser, if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice; any capacity in which the bank\npossesses investment discretion on behalf of another; or any other similar capacity that the OCC authorizes pursuant\nto 12 USC 92a.\u201d See 12 CFR 9.2(e).\n31 National banks do not need the trust or fiduciary powers found in sections 92a to offer these custodial services.\nThus, no trust powers are necessary in order to conduct these activities. See Conditional Approval 267.\n32 See, e.g., Conditional Approval 267 (agency services such as custody that do not involve fiduciary powers are\nperformed by banks as part of their incidental powers); OCC Interpretive Letter 1078 (April 19, 2007) (authority of\nnational banks to engage in custody activities derives from general business of banking, and from incidental powers\nlanguage in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24(Seventh)).\n33 See, generally, Comptroller\u2019s Handbook, Unique and Hard-to-Value Assets (August 2012) (providing guidance\non bank management of unique assets and listing examples of such assets, including real estate, closely held\nbusinesses, mineral interests, loans and notes, life insurance, tangible assets, and collectibles). See also\nComptroller\u2019s Handbooks on Custody Services (Jan. 2002) (Custody Handbook), Asset Management (Dec. 2000),\nAsset Management Operations and Controls (Jan. 2011), Retirement Plan Products and Services (Feb. 2014),\nConflicts of Interest (Jan. 2015); OCC Bulletin 2013\u201329, \u201cThird-Party Relationships\u2014Risk Management Guidance\u201d\n(Oct. 30, 2013).\n34 See Custody Handbook at 19, 70 (describing book-entry securities as securities that transfer electronically and\nstating that banks should assess their technological readiness to maintain a competitive position).\n35 See Custody Handbook at 7.\n7 means.36 Providing such services is permissible in both non-fiduciary and fiduciary capacities.\nA bank that provides custody for cryptocurrency in a non-fiduciary capacity would essentially\nprovide safekeeping for the cryptographic key that allows for control and transfer of the\ncustomer\u2019s cryptocurrency. In most, if not all, circumstances, providing custody for\ncryptocurrency will not entail any physical possession of the cryptocurrency. Rather, a bank\n\u201cholding\u201d digital currencies on behalf of a customer is actually taking possession of the\ncryptographic access keys to that unit of cryptocurrency.37 As described above, the OCC has\nfound that the authority to provide safekeeping services extends to digital activities and,\nspecifically, that national banks may escrow encryption keys used in connection with digital\ncertificates because a key escrow service is a functional equivalent to physical safekeeping.\nHolding the cryptographic access key to a unit of cryptocurrency is an electronic corollary of\nthese traditional safekeeping activities. The OCC\u2019s regulations in Subpart E of Part 7 explicitly\nauthorize national banks to perform, provide or deliver through electronic means and facilities\nany activities that they are otherwise authorized to perform.38 Because national banks are\nauthorized to perform safekeeping and custody services for physical assets, national banks are\nlikewise permitted to provide those same services via electronic means (i.e., custody of\ncryptocurrency).39\n36 12 CFR 7.5002(a) provides that a national bank may perform, provide, or deliver through electronic means and\nfacilities any activity, function, product, or service that it is otherwise authorized to perform, provide, or deliver.\nThis regulatory provision is based on the longstanding \u201ctransparency doctrine,\u201d under which the OCC looks through\nthe means by which a product is delivered and focuses instead on the authority of the national bank to offer the\nunderlying product or service. See 67 FR 34992, 34996 (May 17, 2002). See also OCC Conditional Approval 369\n(Feb. 25, 2000) (national bank may host a virtual mall consisting of a web page with links to third-party merchants\narranged according to product or service offered); OCC Conditional Approval 304 (Mar. 5, 1999) (electronic bill\npresentment is part of the business of banking); Conditional Approval 267 (a national bank may store electronic\nencryption keys as an expression of the established safekeeping function of banks); OCC Conditional Approval 220\n(Dec. 2, 1996) (the creation, sale, and redemption of electronic stored value in exchange for dollars is part of the\nbusiness of banking because it is the electronic equivalent of issuing circulating notes or other paper-based payment\ndevices like travelers checks).\n37 Banks may offer different methods of providing cryptocurrency custody services, depending on their expertise,\nrisk appetite, and business models. Some banks may offer to store copies of their customers\u2019 private keys while\npermitting the customer to retain their own copy. Such services may be more akin to traditional safekeeping and\nwould permit the customer to retain direct control over their own cryptocurrencies. Other banks may permit\ncustomers to transfer their cryptocurrencies directly to control of the bank, thereby generating new private keys\nwhich would be held by the institution on behalf of the customer. Such services may be more akin to traditional\ncustody services, but as with traditional custody, would not permit the customer to maintain direct control of the\ncryptocurrency. Banks may also offer other custody models that may be appropriate. Banks acting as fiduciaries for\ncryptocurrency should consider how to ensure their custody models comply with requirements of 12 CFR 9.13 and\n12 CFR 150.230-250.\n38 See 12 CFR 7.5002(a).\n39 The services national banks may provide in relation to the cryptocurrency they are custodying may include\nservices such as facilitating the customer\u2019s cryptocurrency and fiat currency exchange transactions, transaction\nsettlement, trade execution, recording keeping, valuation, tax services, reporting, or other appropriate services. A\nbank acting as custodian may engage a sub-custodian for cryptocurrency it holds on behalf of customers and should\ndevelop processes to ensure that the sub-custodian\u2019s operations have proper internal controls to protect the\ncustomer\u2019s cryptocurrency. See, e.g., Custody Handbook at 15-16. As set forth below, banks should develop and\nimplement new activities in accordance with OCC guidance.\n8 To the extent that a national bank with trust powers conducts cryptocurrency custody\nactivities in a fiduciary capacity, such activities would be permissible if conducted in compliance\nwith 12 CFR Part 9, applicable state law, and any other applicable law, such as the instrument\nthat created the fiduciary relationship. A national bank holding cryptocurrencies in a fiduciary\ncapacity\u2014such as a trustee, an executor of a will, an administrator of an estate, a receiver, or as\nan investment advisor\u2014would have the authority to manage them in the same way banks can\nmanage other assets they hold as fiduciaries.40\nThese conclusions apply equally to federal savings associations (FSAs). Like national\nbanks, FSAs may provide custody services in either a fiduciary or non-fiduciary capacity. The\nOCC may grant fiduciary powers to an FSA under 12 U.S.C. 1464(n).41 These fiduciary\nactivities of an FSA must be conducted in compliance with 12 CFR Part 150. In addition, FSAs\nhave authority to act as a non-fiduciary custodian under 12 U.S.C. 1464.42 Similar to national\nbanks, FSAs are authorized to \u201cuse, or participate with others to use, electronic means or\nfacilities to perform any function, or provide any product or service, as part of an authorized\nactivity.\u201d43 Accordingly, for the same reasons described above with respect to national banks,\nproviding custody services for cryptocurrency falls within an FSA\u2019s established authority to\nprovide custody services.\nA national bank or FSA engaging in new activities should develop and implement those\nactivities consistent with sound risk management practices and align them with the bank\u2019s\noverall business plans and strategies as set forth in OCC guidance.44 There may be services that\nbanks may provide in connection with cryptocurrencies that are unique to cryptocurrency.45 As\nwith all other activities performed by national banks and FSAs, a national bank or FSA that\nprovides cryptocurrency custody services must conduct these activities in a safe and sound\n40 National banks acting as fiduciaries are usually subject to heightened standards of care under applicable law in\ncomparison to non-fiduciaries. Given the continued evolution of the cryptocurrency sector, banks managing\ncryptocurrency as fiduciaries should ensure they keep abreast of best practices to ensure they continue to meet these\nheightened standards.\n41 12 U.S.C. 1464(n)(1) states, \u201cThe Comptroller may grant by special permit to a Federal savings\nassociation applying therefor the right to act as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or in any other fiduciary\ncapacity in which State banks, trust companies, or other corporations which compete with Federal savings\nassociations are permitted to act under the laws of the State in which the Federal savings association is located.\u201d\n42 See Testimony of John Bowman, Chief Counsel, Office of Thrift Supervision, before the Senate Committee on\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (June 22, 2004) (HOLA allows thrifts to provide trust and custody services on\nthe same basis as national banks).\n43 See 12 CFR 155.200(a).\n44 See OCC Bulletin 2017-43, \u201cNew, Modified, or Expanded Bank Products and Services: Risk Management\nPrinciples\u201d (Oct. 20, 2017).\n45 Custody agreements are an important risk management tool and should clearly establish the custodian\u2019s duties\nand responsibilities. See Custody Handbook at 8. The handling, treatment, and servicing of cryptocurrencies held\nin custody may raise unique issues that should be addressed in the agreement, such as (for example) the treatment of\n\u201cforks\u201d or splits in the code underlying the cryptocurrency being held.\n9 manner, including having adequate systems in place to identify, measure, monitor, and control\nthe risks of its custody services. Such systems should include policies, procedures, internal\ncontrols, and management information systems governing custody services. Effective internal\ncontrols include safeguarding assets under custody, producing reliable financial reports, and\ncomplying with laws and regulations. The OCC has previously described that custody activities\nshould include dual controls, segregation of duties and accounting controls.46 A custodian\u2019s\naccounting records and internal controls should ensure that assets of each custody account are\nkept separate from the assets of the custodian and maintained under joint control to ensure that\nthat an asset is not lost, destroyed or misappropriated by internal or external parties. Other\nconsiderations include settlement of transactions, physical access controls, and security\nservicing. Such controls may need to be tailored in the context of digital custody. Specialized\naudit procedures may be necessary to ensure the bank\u2019s controls are effective for digital custody\nactivities. For example, procedures for verifying that a bank maintains access controls for a\ncryptographic key will differ from the procedures used for physical assets. Banks seeking to\nengage in these activities should also conduct legal analysis to ensure the activities are conducted\nconsistent with all applicable laws.\nConsistent with OCC regulations and guidance on custody activities, the risks associated\nwith an individual account should be addressed prior to acceptance.47 A custodian\u2019s acceptance\nprocess should provide an adequate review of the customer\u2019s needs and wants, as well as the\noperational needs of the account. During the acceptance process, the custodian should also\nassess whether the contemplated duties are within its capabilities and are consistent with all\napplicable law. Understanding the risks of cryptocurrency, the due diligence process should\ninclude a review for compliance with anti-money laundering rules. Banks should also have\neffective information security infrastructure and controls in place to mitigate hacking, theft, and\nfraud. Banks should also be aware that different cryptocurrencies may have different technical\ncharacteristics and may therefore require risk management procedures specific to that particular\ncurrency. Different cryptocurrencies may also be subject to different OCC regulations and\nguidance outside of the custody context, as well as non-OCC regulations.48 A national bank\nshould consult with OCC supervisors as appropriate prior to engaging in cryptocurrency custody\nactivities. The OCC will review these activities as part of its ordinary supervisory processes.\nI trust this is responsive to your inquiry.\n46 See Custody Handbook at 6-8. Banks with fiduciary powers that hold assets as fiduciaries are subject to the\nrequirements of 12 CFR Part 9 (for national banks) and Part 150 (for FSAs). These regulations include specific\nprovisions governing the custody of fiduciary assets.

This letter also\nreaffirms that the crypto-asset custody, distributed ledger, and stablecoin activities (hereafter,\n\u201ccrypto-asset activities\u201d) discussed in prior letters are permissible. Specifically, the OCC issued\nthree interpretive letters in 2020 and early 2021 addressing whether it is permissible for national\nbanks and federal savings associations (collectively, \u201cbanks\u201d) to engage in crypto-asset\nactivities. These interpretive letters are:\n\u2022 OCC Interpretive Letter 1170 (July 22, 2020), addressing whether banks may provide\ncrypto-asset custody services;\n\u2022 OCC Interpretive Letter 1172 (September 21, 2020), addressing whether banks may hold\ndollar deposits serving as reserves backing stablecoins in certain circumstances; and\n\u2022 OCC Interpretive Letter 1174 (January 4, 2021), addressing whether banks may (1) act as\nnodes on an independent node verification network (i.e., a distributed ledger) to verify\ncustomer payments and (2) engage in certain stablecoin activities to facilitate payment\ntransactions on a distributed ledger.\nSince the issuance of Interpretive Letter 1179,1 OCC staff have continued to develop\nknowledge and expertise regarding crypto-asset activities. Based on this supervisory experience,\nthe OCC has determined that Interpretive Letter 1179 is no longer necessary. This rescission is\nintended to reduce burden, encourage responsible innovation, and enhance transparency. The\nrescission will also ensure that bank activities will be treated consistently, regardless of the\nunderlying technology.\nThe OCC will examine the activities described in Interpretive Letters 1170, 1172, and\n1174 as part of its ongoing supervisory process. As with any activity, banks must conduct all\ncrypto-asset activities in a safe, sound, and fair manner and in compliance with applicable law.\nNew activities should be developed and implemented consistent with sound risk management\npractices and align with banks\u2019 overall business plans and strategies.\n\/s\/\nRodney E. Hood\nActing Comptroller of the Currency\n1 Interpretive Letter 1179 outlined a supervisory nonobjection process for banks that seek to engage in the activities\naddressed in Interpretive Letters 1170, 1172, or 1174.",

Introduction\nThe OCC seeks public comment on community banks\u2019 engagement with digitalization.1\nThis RFI will supplement the OCC\u2019s understanding of these activities and support the OCC in its\nsupervisory activities.\nII. Community Bank Digitalization\nThe OCC supports the strengthening and modernization of community banks and aims to\nfacilitate community banks\u2019 safe, sound, and fair transition to digital banking, including with\nregard to arrangements with technology providers and supporting a level playing field. In support\nof community banks\u2019 transition to digital solutions, the OCC recently published a non-exhaustive\nlist of relevant OCC rules, statements, and guidance2 that community banks can reference.\nFor purposes of this RFI, digitalization is the use of technology to change a business\nmodel, provide new revenue and value-producing opportunities, or automate business processes.\n1 The term \u201cbanks\u201d as used in this RFI means national banks and Federal savings associations.\n2 See Digitalization: Resources for Community Banks, OCC Bulletin 2025-3, (March 19, 2025).\n3 New and emerging technologies can be important tools for community banks to meet customer\ndemand, increase revenue, improve efficiencies, and remain competitive. For example,\ndigitalization can improve operational functions (e.g., data analytics, transaction monitoring,\nprocess improvements, reporting, etc.), support the addition of new or expanded business lines,\nand allow banks to communicate more seamlessly with customers. In this way, digitalization has\nthe potential to be a key component of community banking and institutions\u2019 ability to meet the\nfuture needs of the communities and customers they serve. When engaging in digitalization\nstrategies and initiatives, the OCC examines banks for safety and soundness and compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws. Banks are expected to\nimplement risk management systems appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature,\nscope, and risk of its activities to identify, measure, monitor, and control risks for the strategies\nundertaken.\nThe OCC seeks input from community banks and relevant stakeholders regarding the key\nchallenges and barriers faced in adopting and implementing digitalization strategies and\ninitiatives. The purpose of this RFI is to better understand the specific obstacles that community\nbanks encounter in their efforts to modernize operations, enhance customer experience, and\nremain competitive in an increasingly digital financial services environment. This request is\nseparate from the \u201cRFI on Bank-Fintech Arrangements Involving Banking Products and Services\nDistributed to Consumers and Businesses,\u201d3 jointly issued by the OCC, Federal Reserve, and\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation in July 2024. The agencies continue to review and\nconsider the feedback received on that document.\n3 89 FR 61577 (July 31, 2024).\n4 We invite community banks, industry groups, technology providers, and other interested\nparties to respond to the following questions:\n1. Planning for Digitalization: What are the primary challenges facing community banks in\npursuing digitalization strategies or initiatives? To what extent is digitalization a strategic\npriority for community banks, and what factors influence this prioritization? How are community\nbanks addressing the need to obtain subject matter expertise to make informed risk-based\ndecisions about digitalization strategies, initiatives, or their implementation? What challenges, if\nany, are community banks facing in hiring or retaining qualified personnel (e.g., information\ntechnology, cybersecurity, compliance, audit, and other assurance roles) to support digitalization\nstrategies or initiatives?\n2. Board and Governance: How are community banks\u2019 boards of directors engaged in\noverseeing and supporting digitalization strategies and initiatives? What challenges do\ncommunity banks\u2019 boards of directors face when seeking education or considering opportunities\nregarding digitalization? How do community banks\u2019 boards balance the pursuit of a digitalization\nstrategy with their overall risk appetite and the bank\u2019s long-term mission? Describe the\ngovernance processes or policies in place to ensure that community banks\u2019 digitalization\nstrategies or initiatives align with their overall business strategy and regulatory obligations to\noperate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n3. Due Diligence and Implementation: What factors are affecting community banks\u2019 due\ndiligence and pre-implementation research of digital solutions? What are the most common\nobstacles facing community bank digitalization during the due diligence and pre-implementation\nphase, and how are community banks overcoming them? What are the most common obstacles\n5 facing community bank digitalization during the implementation phase, and how are community\nbanks overcoming them?\n4. Digitalization Costs and Budget: A digitalization strategy can involve significant up-front\nand ongoing costs and resources. What types of up-front costs, ongoing costs, and resources are\nassociated with undertaking a digitalization strategy? How are potential budget constraints\nimpacting community banks\u2019 ability to adopt or maintain digitalization strategies?\n5. Use of Third Parties: To what extent are community banks reliant on third parties (e.g.,\ncore service providers, technology vendors, financial technology firms (fintechs), regulatory\ncompliance solutions, etc.) for the implementation of digitalization strategies or initiatives? How\nis this reliance managed? Are there any impediments to community banks\u2019 digitalization\nstrategies with respect to core service providers or other third parties? Are community banks able\nto address these impediments, and if so, how do they enhance their control environments to best\nmanage third-party relationships in light of these impediments? Are community banks finding\nthird-party solutions meet their specific digitalization needs? If not, where are community banks\nfacing the biggest gaps? What is the range of practice for community banks working with a\nsingle third-party provider for an integrated approach to digitalization versus engaging multiple\nthird-party providers to address specific needs? What are the benefits and challenges of each\napproach? How are banks managing the risk that a third party may introduce a new technology\n(e.g., artificial intelligence (AI)) or process without the bank\u2019s prior knowledge, potentially\nincreasing risk outside of the bank\u2019s risk appetite?\n6. Competition and Market Trends: How do community banks see digitalization affecting\ntheir competitiveness with fintechs, larger banks, and similarly situated community banks?\nDescribe any risks associated with the lack of digitalization strategies or initiatives. How do\n6 trends and customers\u2019 demands for digitalization impact community banks\u2019 digitalization\nstrategies and initiatives? How do community banks gather feedback on customer demands and\nchanging technology needs?\n7. Use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: How are community banks\nincorporating AI and machine learning (ML) into their digitalization strategies and initiatives?\nHow has this use evolved as new forms of AI become commercially available, such as generative\nAI? Are banks using AI primarily for cost savings and efficiency, revenue-generating activities,\nor other reasons? How are banks evolving their risk management to address the use of AI and\nML, including when introduced through a third-party relationship? How can regulators support\ncommunity banks\u2019 adoption of AI and ML?\n8. Effect of Applicable Laws and Regulations: How do regulatory and compliance\nrequirements impact the decision to undertake digitalization strategies or initiatives? What\nregulatory, compliance, or supervisory requirements present the greatest challenges to\ndigitalization at community banks? How are banks using digitalization strategies and initiatives\nto increase the effectiveness or efficiency of compliance programs? How can regulators support\ncommunity bank adaptation and competitiveness amid continued digitalization and technological\nevolution?\n9. Associated Risks: How do community banks manage the ongoing risks of digitalization\nthat may result in material financial risks? How do community banks and third-party providers,\nincluding fintechs, approach cybersecurity and data privacy concerns when considering the\nimplementation of new technology at a community bank? How are community banks\nsafeguarding against the evolving nature of threats arising from bad actors\u2019 use of new\n7 technology? How can regulators support community banks\u2019 adoption of new technologies and\nthe management of associated risks?\n10. Data Sharing: To what extent do community banks share data with third-party providers,\nincluding fintechs, as part of a digitalization strategy or initiative? What challenges or concerns\nare encountered in facilitating secure and compliant data sharing? How are community banks\nmanaging connectivity (e.g., by using an application programming interface (API), secure file\ntransfer protocol (SFTP), or some other method) for the secure sharing of data with third-party\nproviders? Are there any limitations or constraints within community banks\u2019 API offerings, such\nas restrictions on functionality, data accessibility, scalability, or third-party compatibility? If so,\nwhat measures, frameworks, or technologies are community banks using to ensure seamless data\nexchange, interoperability, and secure communication across different platforms, core banking\nsystems, and external fintechs?\nThe Honorable Rodney E. Hood,\nActing Comptroller of the Currency\n8",

    "cleaned_text":"Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood\nRemarks at the U.S. Department of Treasury\nFinancial Literacy Roundtable\nApril 30, 2025\nI am delighted to be with this august group today and moderate this panel to mark Financial\nLiteracy Month. As Secretary Bessant said at the start of the month, \u201cFinancial literacy is a\nnecessity\u2014just like reading and writing.\u201d I know that we will have a great discussion about\nhow to make that a reality in more communities around the country, especially our nation\u2019s\nrural and Native places.\nWhile my 30 years of experience in financial services and in government have shown me the\nimportance of financial education and inclusion, let me take a moment to talk about the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC was created over 160 years ago to\nprovide a banking system that contributes to the strength and stability of our nation. The\nOCC\u2019s mission is to ensure that banks operate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair\naccess to financial services, treat customers fairly, and comply with applicable laws and\nregulations. The safety, soundness, and trust in banks power the U.S. economy.\nFinancial literacy helps drive our financial system. Financially literate consumers understand\nand use our robust financial system to effectively manage their day-to-day needs, use capital\nto invest in themselves, their businesses, and their communities, and build wealth for\nthemselves and future generations. Financial literacy also enables consumers to preserve their\nwell-being by avoiding frauds and scams. Financial knowledge is not enough, however.\nFinancial institutions need to provide consumers with access to products and services that\nmeet their needs. When I talk about financial inclusion, I mean that consumers of all kinds\nhave the knowledge and the products that enable them to attain financial health and well-\nbeing. The OCC has long supported banks\u2019 work to promote financial education for their customers\nand their communities, by providing information and resources on best practices, like our\nquarterly Financial Literacy Update, Insights reports on key financial literacy and inclusion\ntopics, and online resource directories. Our OCC staff also makes connections between banks\nand trusted community partners in low- and moderate-income communities. As an example,\nlast Friday, a team from the OCC volunteered at Junior Achievement Finance Park in\nMaryland teaching students from Hyattsville Middle School about budgets and navigating\nthe financial world. Our team saw firsthand the impact that quality financial education has on\nhelping students understand the choices they will need to make as adults. The OCC is also\npleased to work with Treasury and other members of the Financial Literacy and Education\nCommission to promote financial education for all Americans, and especially for those\npeople and communities who could most benefit from enhanced financial inclusion.\nI am especially interested in hearing from you today about how financial institutions, CDFIs,\nand financial educators are evolving to match the needs in the rapidly changing financial\nmarketplace. As more options are available to consumers and investors, including digital\nfinancial products and services, and financial information\u2014correct and incorrect\u2014is\nprovided through social media, we can discuss how trusted and tested financial educators\nrespond and are ready for what\u2019s next.\nI look forward to hearing from this group today about your successes and challenges, and how\nTreasury and the OCC can support your work. I also encourage all of you to listen and learn\nfrom each other and consider ways to collaborate to advance the important work of building\na financially educated, inclusive, and active country.\n2",

I wish I could be there with you all today, but duty called me away from\nthe nation\u2019s capital. I would like to thank the National Fair Housing Alliance for organizing this\nimportant event and for inviting me to speak. Responsibly expanding access to capital and\nhelping people attain financial security are among my core values. I know we share those\nprinciples.\nMy career has spanned nearly three decades, including positions at three Wall Street\nfirms as well as another federal regulator. In every role I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve focused on the importance\nof financial inclusion for underserved communities because I know how transformative it can be\nwhen people gain access to quality, affordable financial services.\nMake no mistake: financial inclusion is the civil rights challenge of our generation.\nThat\u2019s why my focus on this has been unwavering, and I encourage innovative thinking among\nstakeholders in financial services about how we can lead the way to foster greater financial\ninclusion. During my tenure as the NCUA Chairman, I made financial inclusion a priority for the\nagency and the cooperative credit system. I continue to champion this topic at the OCC because I\ntruly believe national banks and federal savings associations should help all people to access our\nfinancial mainstream. In that vein, I am honored to be able to share a few thoughts about the important work we\nare doing at the OCC to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other\ntechnologies.\nThe Role of the U.S. in Advancing AI in Financial Services\nAmerican technological innovation is unparalleled in its ingenuity and ability to advance\nprosperity. This has made the United States a global leader in AI innovation. To remain a leader,\nwe must ensure that innovations are fit for purpose and that the innovative banking products,\nservices, and business arrangements arising from the adoption of new and emerging technologies\nare responsible and trustworthy. This requires effective, but not burdensome, regulatory\noversight. We also must ensure that our citizens have opportunities to acquire the knowledge and\nskills they need to become our future innovators and to help drive productivity and prosperity.\nArtificial intelligence is transforming the way we live and work. It holds tremendous\npotential for financial institutions in terms of optimizing processes and democratizing\nopportunities by providing new ways to meet the needs of the historically unbanked and under-\nbanked.\nFor example, the OCC has observed banks using AI in various areas of risk management\nand business operations, including fraud detection and prevention, identification of suspicious\nactivity, facilitation of automated trading, automation of loan origination processes, and\nmarketing and customer service.\nAI also can help banks make more informed decisions, enhance efficiency, and provide\nbetter and more customized services to households and businesses of all sizes. But that is only if\nthis powerful technology is built and used responsibly.\n2 Ensuring Safe and Responsible AI\nAs Acting Comptroller of the Currency, I am committed to ensuring that AI is used in a\nsafe, secure, and trustworthy manner in the federal banking system.\nOver the years, the OCC has taken proactive steps to effectively advance governance\naround the use of AI in the financial services sector. The OCC has developed regulatory\nframeworks and issued guidance and principles to ensure that all technologies, including AI, are\nused ethically and responsibly within the banking industry. This includes guidelines on\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness.\nThe OCC also emphasizes the importance of robust risk management practices for AI\napplications, consistent with conventional model risk management practices. This includes\nassessing and mitigating potential risks associated with AI, such as bias, security vulnerabilities,\nand fraud.\nSuch robust risk management practices are necessary because, compared to conventional\nanalytical systems and techniques, AI is generally more complex. Reliance on intricate\nalgorithms, and in some cases, vast amounts of data may cause some uses of AI to produce\noutputs through processes that may be more difficult to understand or explain. AI models may\nalso intuit relationships among variables that humans cannot, thereby presenting the risk of\nunintentionally perpetuating historical patterns of bias and discrimination.\nBanks should consider the risk-based and technology-neutral principles in existing OCC\nand interagency guidance as part of their governance and risk management of AI uses.\nIn addition, the OCC has established the Office of Financial Technology to analyze and\nevaluate developments in financial technology, including AI. This office supports the\n3 development of policy guidance, outreach, and supervision resources for AI-related business\nmodels and applications. The office also focuses on innovations in the area of technology,\nincluding bank-fintech arrangements, AI adoption, digital assets and tokenization, and other\nareas.\nWe also champion the use of AI to expand access to credit and other financial services.\nFor example, AI can utilize alternative data, such as rent payments and cash flow information, to\nimprove credit models and increase financial inclusion. This can enable consumers to obtain\nadditional products or more favorable terms based on enhanced assessments of repayment\ncapacity.\nCollaboration and Innovation\nThe OCC also believes in fostering collaboration in innovation. We actively engage with\nindustry leaders, policymakers, nonprofits, and other stakeholders to promote the responsible\nadoption of AI. Collaboration between government agencies, industry leaders, and other\nstakeholders is crucial for building trust and a shared vision within the ecosystem. By working\ntogether, we can more effectively share information and promote innovation while safeguarding\nthe interests of consumers, businesses, and the communities where we live and work.\nI am proud to highlight the financial inclusion efforts of the OCC\u2019s Project REACh.\nProject REACh\u2014which stands for the Roundtable for Economic Access and Change\u2014brings\ntogether leaders in banking, civil rights, community development, and technology to identify\ninnovative solutions to financial inclusion for economically disadvantaged communities. It is an\ninitiative that has demonstrated enormous impact.\n4 For example, through REACh convenings, financial institutions developed an affordable\ncredit solution for consumers who were unable to access credit because they lacked a credit file\nand did not have a credit score. This resulted in more than 100,000 accounts established under\nthis pilot.\nToday, several national banks have developed a pilot program under Project REACh to\nexpand the use of alternative, non-FICO data\u2014primarily from deposit accounts\u2014to qualify\ncredit-impaired consumers for affordable lines of credit and bring them into the regulated\nfinancial system.\nProject REACh also recently launched a workstream on affordable homeownership,\nwhich will address the challenges that disadvantaged and underserved consumers face in\npurchasing homes and encourages the development of innovative products and services that\nimprove access to credit. Separately, we launched a technology workstream exploring expanding\nfinancial inclusion through new technologies or novel uses of existing technologies.\nEnsuring Fairness\nAs always, the OCC works to ensure adherence to our nation\u2019s fair housing and lending\nlaws. This is crucially important. Fairness is central to a productive, well-functioning, and\nprosperous society and markets and helps expand business and other opportunities.\nConversely, unfair systems can restrict access to credit and hinder progress. I recently\nannounced the OCC\u2019s new Office of External Relations and Strategic Partnerships. This office,\nwhich will be led by Andrew Moss, my Acting Chief of Staff and the agency\u2019s National Director\nfor Project REACh,will be responsible for developing our comprehensive financial inclusion\nstrategy. It will also engage with critical external stakeholders to identify economic barriers,\n5 build partnerships, promote education, and encourage responsible innovation to foster increased\ninclusion in the federal banking system.\nConclusion\nAs we navigate the complexities of AI, I challenge all stakeholders to remain committed\nto using this technology for the greater good. Together, we can shape a future where\ntechnologies enhance our society and uphold our shared values.\nThank you again for inviting me to participate today. I look forward to our continued\ncollaboration and learning more about the insightful discussions and innovative solutions that\nwill emerge from this symposium.\n6",

(Bank), and Paul McLinko, former Executive Audit Director at the Bank. In the Consent Orders memorializing the settlements, the OCC assessed a $100,000 civil money penalty against Mr. Julian and a $50,000 civil money penalty against Mr. McLinko and issued personal cease and desist orders to both former executives. These orders resolve the enforcement actions the OCC initiated against Mr. Julian and Mr. McLinko in January 2020 in connection with the Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding systemic sales practices misconduct, as well as the former Bank executives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 appeal of Final Decisions issued by the OCC on January 14, 2025 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The OCC previously entered into Consent Orders with eight other former Wells Fargo senior executives related to systemic sales practices misconduct as announced on January 23, 2020, September 21, 2020, January 15, 2021, and March 15, 2023. To date, the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions have resulted in more than $43 million in penalties against these former executives. All fines have been paid to the U.S. Treasury.

Pursuant to 12 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1818(i)(2)(F), the ALJ may recommend and the Comptroller may decide to increase the\namount of the civil money penalties assessed herein, consistent with the law and the evidence\npresented during the proceedings.\nThe hearing afforded Respondents shall be open to the public unless the Comptroller, in\nhis discretion, determines that holding an open hearing would be contrary to the public interest.\nIn support of this Notice of Charges for Orders of Prohibition and Orders to Cease and\nDesist, and Notice of Assessments of a Civil Money Penalty (\u201cNotice\u201d), the OCC charges the\nfollowing: 1\n1 Pursuant to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.33(b), Enforcement Counsel is filing under seal an unredacted version of the Notice of\nCharges concurrently with this version.\n2 ARTICLE I\nTHE COMMUNITY BANK PROMOTED AND MAINTAINED A BUSINESS MODEL\nTHAT INCENTIVIZED EMPLOYEES TO ENGAGE IN SERIOUS MISCONDUCT FOR\nMANY YEARS\n(1) At all times relevant to the Notice, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South\nDakota (\u201cBank\u201d) was a national banking association within the meaning of 12 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1813(q)(1)(A) and an \u201cinsured depository institution\u201d as defined in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(c)(2).\n(2) The Community Bank was and is the Bank\u2019s largest line of business and houses\nthe Bank\u2019s retail branch network.\n(3) The Community Bank had a systemic and well-known problem with sales\npractices misconduct that persisted for at least 14 years, beginning no later than 2002.\n(4) The term \u201csales practices misconduct,\u201d as used in this Notice, refers to the\npractices of Bank employees issuing a product or service to a customer without the customer\u2019s\nconsent, transferring customer funds without the customer\u2019s consent, or obtaining a customer\u2019s\nconsent by making false or misleading representations.\n(5) The root cause of the sales practices misconduct problem was the Community\nBank\u2019s business model, which imposed intentionally unreasonable sales goals and unreasonable\npressure on its employees to meet those goals and fostered an atmosphere that perpetuated\nimproper and illegal conduct. Community Bank management intimidated and badgered\nemployees to meet unattainable sales goals year after year, including by monitoring employees\ndaily or hourly and reporting their sales performance to their managers, subjecting employees to\nhazing-like abuse, and threatening to terminate and actually terminating employees for failure to\nmeet the goals.\n3 (6) The Community Bank\u2019s business model was highly profitable because it resulted\nin a greater number of legitimate sales than would have been possible without the unreasonable\nsales goals and sales pressure. The unauthorized products and services that were issued to\ncustomers also resulted in a financial benefit to Respondents and the Bank. The Bank touted a\nmetric known as \u201ccross-sell,\u201d or the \u201ccross-sell ratio,\u201d that measured the number of products sold\nper household. The unauthorized products and services issued to customers inflated the cross-sell\nmetric and resulted in enhanced stock price. The Bank tolerated pervasive sales practices\nmisconduct as an acceptable side effect of the Community Bank\u2019s profitable sales model, and\ndeclined to implement effective controls to catch systemic misconduct. Instead, to avoid\nupsetting a financially profitable business model, senior executives, including Respondents,\nturned a blind eye to illegal and improper conduct across the entire Community Bank. The Bank\nhad better tools and systems to detect employees who did not meet unreasonable sales goals than\nit did to catch employees who engaged in sales practices misconduct. To the extent the Bank did\nimplement controls, the Bank intentionally designed and maintained controls to catch only the\nmost egregious instances of the illegal conduct that was pervasive throughout the Community\nBank. In short, Bank senior executives favored profits and other market rewards over taking\naction to stop the systemic issuance of unauthorized products and services to customers.\n(7) The Community Bank\u2019s business model and the senior leaders of the Bank\npresented a stark dilemma to employees every day for 14 years: they could engage in sales\npractices misconduct\u2014much of which was illegal\u2014to meet their goals, or they could struggle to\nmeet their goals and face adverse consequences, including losing their jobs.\n(8) The Community Bank\u2019s business model caused hundreds of thousands of\nemployees to engage in numerous types of sales practices misconduct, including:\n4 a. opening and issuing millions of unauthorized checking and savings accounts,\ndebit cards, and credit cards;\nb. transferring customer funds between accounts without customer consent, a\npractice the Bank refers to as \u201csimulated funding\u201d;\nc. misrepresenting to customers that certain products were available only in\npackages with other products, known as \u201cbundling\u201d;\nd. enrolling customers in online banking and online bill-pay without consent, known\nas \u201cpinning\u201d;\ne. delaying the opening of requested accounts and other products to the next sales\nreporting period, known as \u201csandbagging\u201d; and\nf. accessing and falsifying personal customer account information without\nauthorization such as customer phone numbers, home addresses, and email\naddresses.\n(9) The Respondents in this proceeding are:\na. Carrie Tolstedt, the former Head of the Community Bank, who reported to the\nChief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d);\nb. Claudia Russ Anderson, the former Community Bank Group Risk Officer, who\nreported to Respondent Tolstedt;\nc. James Strother, the former General Counsel, who reported to the CEO;\nd. David Julian, the former Chief Auditor, who reported to the Audit and\nExamination Committee of the Board and administratively to the CEO; and\ne. Paul McLinko, the former Executive Audit Director responsible for Community\nBank audits, who reported to Respondent Julian.\n5 (10) The Bank had three lines of defense which, together with the Law Department,\nwere tasked with controlling and managing risk. The Community Bank was the first line of\ndefense. Corporate Risk was the second line of defense. Audit was the third line of defense. The\nLaw Department often performed both first line and second line of defense activities.\n(11) The most senior executives of the Bank were members of a group called the\nOperating Committee, which included the CEO and his direct reports, including Respondents\nTolstedt, Strother, and Julian.\n(12) During the OCC\u2019s investigation of the Bank\u2019s sales practices misconduct, the\nOCC subpoenaed each Respondent to testify. In sworn testimony before the OCC, Respondents\nStrother, Julian, and McLinko admitted that the Bank had a systemic sales practices misconduct\nproblem rooted in the Community Bank\u2019s business model.\n(13) In testimony before the OCC, Respondents Tolstedt and Russ Anderson asserted\ntheir Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and accordingly refused to answer all\nsubstantive questions about sales practices misconduct.\n(14) In sworn testimony before the OCC, former CEO John Stumpf admitted, based on\nthe information presented to him during his testimony, that the Community Bank had a systemic\nsales practices misconduct problem from the early 2000s until sales goals were eliminated in\nOctober of 2016. He further testified that Respondents Tolstedt and Russ Anderson bore\n\u201csignificant responsibility\u201d for the existence and continuation of this problem:\n(15) Specifically, former CEO Stumpf testified:\nQ Okay. Is it fair to say that a systemic problem, as you\nunderstand the dictionary definition, means a problem that is\ninherent in the system, the business model of the company, and can\nonly be corrected by changing the system or the business model of\nthe company?\nA I would agree with that statement.\n6 Q Okay. Given that definition, do you believe that Wells Fargo\nCommunity Bank had a systemic problem with sales practice\nmisconduct, from the early 2000s on until the time you eliminated\nsales goals in October of 2016?\nA As I sit here today --\nQ Yes, sir.\nA -- considering the definition that I looked up and learning the\nthings I've learned here the last few days, I would agree, it was a\nsystemic problem in the Community Bank.\nQ Okay, thank you. And if it is a systemic problem in the\nCommunity Bank, starting from the early 2000s up until September\nof 2016, wouldn't the head of the Community Bank, Ms. Tolstedt,\nbear a significant responsibility for the existence and the\ncontinuation of this systemic problem?\nA I would agree with that.\nQ And wouldn't Ms. Claudia Russ Anderson, the Group Risk\nOfficer for the Community Bank, bear a significant responsibility\nfor the existence and continuation of that problem?\nA I would agree with that statement.\n(16) The systemic sales practices misconduct persisted for years due to the failures of\nBank senior executives and failures in the checks and balances that were supposed to be\nprovided by the Law Department and Audit. The Law Department and Audit\u2014that is,\nRespondents Strother, Julian, and McLinko\u2014had a responsibility to ensure incentive\ncompensation plans were designed and operated in accordance with Bank policy, evaluate risk\nand ensure it was adequately managed and escalated, advise whether the Community Bank was\noperating in conformance with laws and regulations, or identify and detail significant or systemic\nproblems in audit reports. None of the Respondents who held leadership roles in those\ndepartments adequately performed their responsibilities with respect to the sales practices\nmisconduct problem.\n(17) Senior executives at the Bank acknowledge what was known or should have been\nknown all along: that sales practices misconduct was a significant and systemic problem, and\nsales goals were unattainable and a significant part of the root cause of the sales practices\n7 misconduct problem. For example, Respondent Strother agreed in testimony before the OCC that\n\u201ceven after [sales goals] were lowered, even with the pressure and even with the cheating, people\nstill can\u2019t meet them.\u201d\n(18) In sworn testimony before the OCC, Respondent Julian agreed that the\nCommunity Bank had a serious systemic issue with sales practices misconduct and that he would\ncharacterize the root cause of the problem as \u201cthe goals were unattainable or unreasonable, and\nthe pressure to meet those unattainable goals was severe.\u201d\n(19) In sworn testimony before the OCC, Respondent McLinko agreed that there was a\nsystemic sales practices misconduct problem in the branch environment of the Community Bank\nand \u201cthe sales goals and incentive processes were certainly two areas that contributed\nsignificantly to the issue, the pressure for the sales goals.\u201d\n(20) In sworn testimony before the OCC, the Bank\u2019s former Chief Administrative\nOfficer and Director of Human Resources admitted that the Community Bank had a systemic\nsales practices misconduct problem rooted in unreasonable sales goals, and that the Bank\u2019s\nresponse \u201cto this problem was slow and incremental, and ultimately not effective until 2016[.]\u201d\n(21) In 2017, the Independent Directors of the Board of Wells Fargo & Company, the\nBank\u2019s holding company (\u201cCompany\u201d), issued a Sales Practices Investigation Report (\u201cBoard\nReport\u201d). The Board Report concluded that \u201cthe only way definitively to address the broken\nsales model and the root cause of sales practices abuses was to emphasize other metrics for\nperformance and to abandon exerting pressure through sales goals and sales-driven incentive\nprograms.\u201d\n(22) The Board Report found that the Community Bank\u2019s sales goals were\n\u201cuntenable,\u201d \u201cunrealistic,\u201d and \u201cunattainable.\u201d\n8 (23) The Board Report found that, even after the Community Bank made mid-year\ndownward adjustments to sales goals in 2013 and 2014, \u201cthey were still set at an unachievable\nlevel.\u201d\n(24) In October 2016, a former Operating Committee member acknowledged the Bank\nhad a serious and pervasive culture problem that was as basic as failing to recognize right from\nwrong: \u201cWe did not serve John Stumpf well. During his testimony he said we didn\u2019t have a\nculture problem. We do: we have a culture problem in the Community Bank and we have a\ncultural problem at the [Operating Committee] level where we didn\u2019t challenge\/push Carrie\n[Tolstedt] hard enough. . . . Our people opened unauthorized accounts. This is like lying and\nstealing, which your mother taught you was really bad.\u201d\n(25) Everything that the OCC learned in the course of its investigation of the Bank\u2019s\nsales practices misconduct regarding the root cause, scope, duration, and severity of the problem,\nas well as the inadequacy of the controls, was available to Respondents long before September\n2016.\n(26) For more than 14 years, the systemic sales practices misconduct resulted in\ncompromise of customer accounts, misuse of customer personal information, and actual financial\nharm to consumers. As of November 2019, the Bank has refunded at least $42.9 million to\ncustomers in connection with its review of sales practices.\n(27) All Respondents profited personally from the improper business model.\n(28) It took a massive failure on the part of the senior management of the Community\nBank, the Law Department, and Audit for the sales practices misconduct problem to become as\nsevere and pervasive as it was and last as long as it did.\n9 The Sales Practices Misconduct Problem Was Well-Known for Years\n(29) The sales practices misconduct problem and its root cause were well-known for\nyears throughout the Bank, including by Respondents.\n(30) Employees often and consistently complained that the sales goals were unrealistic\nand unreasonable, but to no avail.\n(31) For years, employees and customers tried in vain to alert senior leaders to the\ngrowing and continuing sales practices misconduct problem.\n(32) From 2006 through 2014, total EthicsLine complaints received from employees\nincreased year-over-year.\n(33) Each year, nearly half of all EthicsLine cases investigated by Corporate\nInvestigations related to employee sales integrity violations.\na. The Bank\u2019s Sales Quality Manual defined sales integrity violations as\n\u201cmanipulations and\/or misrepresentations of sales, service or referrals and\nreporting of sales, service or referrals in an attempt to receive compensation or to\nmeet sales and service goals.\u201d\n(34) In a September 2016 email, a senior Bank executive wrote: \u201cI just read the 19\n[EthicsLine] sales practice allegations, and at least 50 percent are exactly both pressure and\ngreed related. It made my hair curl.\u201d\n(35) As early as 2007, lack of customer consent was a primary allegation in EthicsLine\ncomplaints from employees.\n(36) The Bank\u2019s former CEO agreed in testimony before the OCC that employees did\nall they could to complain about the unreasonable sales goals to Bank senior leadership in\nnumerous ways over many years, by calling the EthicsLine, sending emails, holding protests, and\n10 approaching newspapers. He further stated that the senior leadership team, and not the\nemployees, is to blame for the Bank not moving fast enough to address the sales practices\nmisconduct problem.\n(37) In sworn testimony before the OCC, the Bank\u2019s former Chief Administrative\nOfficer and Director of Human Resources agreed that employees sent letters, emails, and\nEthicsLine complaints about pressure and \u201cgaming\u201d for many years.\n(38) The Bank\u2019s former Chief Administrative Officer and Director of Human\nResources agreed in sworn testimony before the OCC that by 2016 she and the rest of the\nOperating Committee, which included Respondents Strother and Julian, understood that\nemployee complaints about \u201cinsane pressure to meet sales goals were, in fact, valid complaints\nthat reflected what was actually going on in the Community Bank for many years.\u201d\n(39) A 2010 employee complaint to Respondents Tolstedt and Strother explained:\n\u201cSurely, you must be aware that you will reach a sales number to be achieved that will force the\nstaff to cheat to obtain it. You have reached that point.\u201d The employee complaint proclaimed to\nBank senior leadership, including Respondents Tolstedt and Strother: \u201c[T]he noose around our\nnecks ha[s] tightened: we have been told we must achieve the required solutions goals or [we]\nwill be terminated. This type of practice guarantees high turnover, a managerial staff of bullying\ntaskmasters, [and] bankers who are really financial molesters [and] cheaters . . . .\u201d\n(40) A 2012 employee complaint sent to Respondents Tolstedt and Strother explained:\n\u201cWhen employees are required to meet unreasonable numbers, they are forced into inappropriate\nactivity to keep their jobs. \u2026 Wells Fargo is playing a shell game \u2013 they are rewarding\nemployees for fake accounts and will terminate them if they find out this is the case. Yet\nmanagement will chastise and come very close to verbal abuse and put employees on written\n11 notice if they are honest and do not open fake accounts to meet these unreasonable goals. The\ntermination ax is suspended over our head one way or another; meet unreasonable goals or you\nwill be terminated, cheat to meet the unreasonable goals and you will be terminated when\ncaught. . . . I am NOT writing this letter to bring an investigation on my store, my district, my\nregion \u2013 that is not where the root of the problem lies. It lies on upper management who has\nincreased the goals to the \u2018must cheat to achieve\u2019 level.\u201d (emphasis in original).\n(41) Another employee wrote to the CEO\u2019s office and to a senior leader in the\nCommunity Bank in 2013 that \u201cI was in the 1991 Gulf War \u2026. This is sad and hard for me to\nsay, but I had less stress in the 1991 Gulf War than working for Wells Fargo.\u201d\n(42) A 2013 employee complaint sent to Respondent Tolstedt explained employee\nsentiments: \u201cMake your goals at any cost to the team member or customer \u2013 this is our\nenvironment. . . . I cant [sic] sleep at night or look in the mirror. Too much pressure, feels like\nwe have to treat team members poorly or walk a very grey line to meet expectations.\u201d\n(43) Customers also contacted senior leaders on many occasions. The Bank received\ntens of thousands of customer calls alleging lack of consent.\na. From December 2013 through September 2015, the Bank received at least 5,000\ncustomer complaints related to lack of consent.\n(44) For example, one customer wrote to the CEO\u2019s office in 2012: \u201cMy rights as a\ncustomer have been violated and I feel extremely vulnerable.\u201d\n(45) In 2013, a customer wrote to Respondent Strother: \u201cI am beyond angry. To me,\nthis is a form of identity theft.\u201d\n(46) In a 2014 complaint forwarded to Respondent Russ Anderson, a customer pointed\nout: \u201cIf I were to take a [stranger\u2019s] information and apply for credit cards with it, I would go to\n12 jail. It is morally and legally criminal. In a world where a credit score controls many important\naspects of your life, it is truly scary that an employee of a financial institution can manipulate my\ninformation and assert himself into my personal and financial life.\u201d\n(47) Customers and employees wrote letters and emails detailing the sales practices\nmisconduct problem to senior executives with the authority and responsibility to address it.\nNonetheless, the sales practices misconduct problem persisted because senior management,\nincluding Respondents, blamed individual employees for the problem, refused to address the\nactual root cause, downplayed the problem\u2019s seriousness and scope, and failed to provide\naccurate and complete reporting on the problem.\n(48) The unauthorized activity was so systemic and pervasive that even senior leaders\nwere not immune to being affected by sales practices misconduct. What should have been a call\nto action was merely brushed off. In the first half of 2012, a former Operating Committee\nmember\u2019s wife received two debit cards in the mail she did not request. He raised this to the\nHead of the Community Bank, Respondent Tolstedt. Respondent Tolstedt later asked the former\nOperating Committee member to stop telling the story because she thought it reflected poorly on\nthe Community Bank. Saving face prevailed over determining and fixing the root cause of the\nsales practices misconduct problem.\n(49) In 2014, an acquaintance of the CEO raised concerns to Bank officials \u201cabout\nsome debit cards he received in the mail without consent.\u201d\n(50) At all times relevant to the Notice, Corporate Investigations was a department\nwithin the Bank responsible for investigating employee misconduct.\n(51) Respondents ignored or minimized warnings regarding sales practices misconduct\nfor years.\n13 (52) A report prepared by Corporate Investigations in 2004 (\u201c2004 Investigation\nReport\u201d) identified instances of misconduct, in which employees were \u201cgaming\u201d the Community\nBank\u2019s sales plan by, among other things, opening products without customer authorization and\nsigning customers up for products they would never know about or use. The report found: \u201cIn\nalmost every case [the employees] related they \u2018gamed\u2019 the system in order to preserve their\nemployment based on the fact they are expected to meet certain goals or lose their job.\u201d The\n2004 Investigation Report recommended that the Bank remove the threat of employee\ntermination if goals are not met.\na. The 2004 Investigation Report found that between 2000 and 2004, gaming cases\nincreased 979% and associated terminations had increased 962%.\nb. The 2004 Investigation Report also found that gaming cases were \u201cgeographically\nconsistent corporate-wide.\u201d\n(53) The sales practices misconduct problem as described in the 2004 Investigation\nReport existed at the Bank until the elimination of sales goals in the Community Bank in October\n2016.\n(54) In 2009, a manager in Corporate Investigations wrote: \u201c[W]e have heard for years\nthat the sales pressure is the cause [of sales practices misconduct], and I for one do not doubt it\nfor a minute. A standard line we hear is \u2018I can play by the rules and get fired for not making\nunrealistic goals or I can cheat and hope I don\u2019t get caught\u2019.\u201d\n(55) In the fall of 2013, the Los Angeles Times published articles detailing the scope\nand root cause of the sales practices misconduct problem. Respondents were well aware of the\narticles and by 2013 at the latest had no excuse not to take immediate and decisive action to\naddress a longstanding problem that plagued the largest line of business at the Bank.\n14 (56) Despite knowledge of the sales practices misconduct problem, its root cause, and\nits duration, there was great reluctance by senior management to make any meaningful changes\nto the business model because the Community Bank was tremendously profitable and central to\nthe Bank\u2019s success.\na. The CEO wrote: \u201cThe Community Bank is \u2018Rome\u2019 in our company\u2014all roads\nlead to and from it.\u201d\nb. Between 2010 and 2016, approximately 55 to 60% of the Company\u2019s average\nannual profits were attributable to the Community Bank.\n(57) A former Chief Security Officer of the Bank testified before the OCC that the\nsales practices misconduct problem persisted for as long as it did because \u201cthe [B]ank was very\nprofitable and doing very well,\u201d and senior leadership perceived sales practices misconduct to\ninvolve few employee terminations and negligible loss to the Bank.\n(58) All Respondents were well compensated over a period of years, with much of\ntheir compensation equity-based, and all profited personally from the improper business model.\nThe Community Bank\u2019s unreasonably high sales goals and pressure increased the profitability\nand purported cross-sell success of the entire Bank, which directly increased their incentive\ncompensation and equity awards.\na. Respondent Tolstedt received millions of dollars annually in incentive\ncompensation, based in part on the profitability of the Bank. Respondent\nTolstedt\u2019s compensation awards explicitly took into account the Community\nBank\u2019s achievement of record cross-sell ratios.\n15 b. Respondents Russ Anderson, Strother, Julian, and McLinko also received\nsignificant annual incentive compensation based in part on the Bank\u2019s financial\nperformance.\nThe Community Bank\u2019s Sales Goals Were Unreasonable\n(59) The Bank maintained and publicly reported a metric known as the \u201ccross-sell\nratio,\u201d a measure of products sold per customer household, as a driver of future revenue. The\nmore products sold to existing households, the more money the Bank would earn from each\nrelationship and the less likely those customers would exit their relationship with the Bank.\n(60) The financial industry and the Bank considered Wells Fargo to be \u201cthe king of\ncross-sell.\u201d\n(61) By 2002, the Bank began proclaiming a goal to sell at least eight products to\nevery customer. Bank mantras included \u201cGoing for Gr-Eight\u201d and \u201cEight is Great.\u201d\n(62) From the early 2000s, the Community Bank pushed an aggressive sales model\nthat increased cross-sell growth by requiring double-digit annual sales growth over the prior\nyear\u2019s sales performance, or \u201crun rate.\u201d\na. For example, the Community Bank developed its 2012 sales plan during 2011.\nThe total number of products and services sold in 2011 was the base upon which\nthe Community Bank expected and planned for growth in 2012.\nb. An email exchange between Respondent Tolstedt and one of her managers from\n2002 illustrates the emphasis on aggressive goals. The executive proposed a plan\nthat provided for a 4% increase in sales. Respondent Tolstedt told the executive in\nan email marked as high importance: \u201cthe front end guidance was a minimum of\n10%.\u201d She further stated: \u201c[w]ould you do me a huge favor and change your sales\n16 plan to reflect a growth rate of between 10% and 15%.\u201d Respondent Tolstedt\nforwarded the email to the CEO stating: \u201c[j]ust so you know I won\u2019t let them get\naway with this!!! \u2026 we need to ensure they [referring to the sales plans] are\nequally hard across all regions.\u201d\nc. In 2011, Respondent Tolstedt told regional leaders that the \u201cStreet rewards us for\n. . . cross-sell and HH [household] cross-sell [s]o expects us to excel here.\u201d\n(63) The Community Bank increased sales goals each year based on the prior year\u2019s\nsales. Due to rampant sales practices misconduct, annual sales included large numbers of\naccounts and products that were unauthorized or otherwise the result of sales practices\nmisconduct.\n(64) Sales practices misconduct artificially inflated annual product sales, increasing the\npressure on employees and compounding the problem because employees would be expected to\nsell even more products in the next year.\n(65) Sales practices misconduct also artificially inflated the cross-sell metric. The\nBank touted the cross-sell metric as an indicator of its success and a reason for enhanced stock\nprice.\n(66) In a presentation shared with Respondent Tolstedt, the Community Bank\u2019s Group\nFinance Officer wrote that sales growth milestones in 2008 were: \u201c\u2018breaking the envelope,\u2019\ndriven by what we considered wild, almost unimaginable, assumptions.\u201d\na. The presentation informed Respondent Tolstedt that to reach the corporate goal of\neight products per household, the Bank needed to increase its sales goals by\ndouble digits every year.\n(67) The Community Bank increased sales goals every year from 2002 until 2013.\n17 (68) The Board Report found that, even after the Community Bank lowered sales goals\nmid-year in 2013 and 2014, \u201cthey were still set at an unachievable level.\u201d\n(69) The incentive compensation plans in the Community Bank were based upon these\nunreasonable sales goals.\nThere Was Excessive Pressure on Employees to Meet Unreasonable Sales Goals\n(70) Employees opened and issued products and services without customer consent\nand altered and misused customers\u2019 personal information because the Community Bank\u2019s\nbusiness model imposed unreasonable goals on its employees and management applied extreme\npressure and threatened corrective action, up to and including termination, if the employees\nfailed to meet their goals.\n(71) Employees investigated for engaging in sales practices misconduct consistently\nexpressed to investigators that they committed the misconduct because they feared they could\nand would be fired for failing to meet the goals.\n(72) It was common knowledge within the Bank that employees who could not meet\nsales goals could and would be terminated.\n(73) A former Chief Administrative Officer from 2005 to 2015 testified before the\nOCC that it was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d at the Bank that employees who failed to meet their sales\ngoals would be terminated. She explained that the Bank \u201cwas a sales organization, and if people\nweren\u2019t meeting their goals, either they were terminated or they quit generally.\u201d\n(74) The Bank\u2019s former Chief Security Officer testified before the OCC that the\nBank\u2019s policy was \u201cmeet your quota . . . or be terminated\u201d and that this policy \u201cforced employees\nto do things against their own will.\u201d\n18 (75) Employees\u2019 fear of being terminated for not meeting unreasonable sales goals was\njustified. From 2011 through third quarter 2016, the Bank terminated approximately 8,520\nemployees for sales performance issues, including failure to meet sales goals.\na. As an example, a store manager received a formal warning in July 2011 because\nher store achieved only 98% and 90% of her store\u2019s sales goals in the first two\nquarters of that year, respectively. The formal warning stated: \u201cIf your sales\nperformance does not improve to an acceptable level, further action up to and\nincluding termination of employment may result.\u201d\n(76) In some cases, even employees who exceeded their sales goals could and did\nreceive corrective action for their sales performance. An investigations manager wrote in a 2009\nemail: \u201c[W]e are hearing the [local regional president] has told or insinuated that everyone must\nmake 120% of their goals, no exceptions. We have been made aware that some team members\nhave actually be[en] form[ally] counseled for making [104%] and 110% of their goals. In\naddition we discovered that one manager was getting ready to terminate a banker for being at\n105%.\u201d\n(77) Employees\u2019 incentive compensation and promotional opportunities depended on\ntheir ability to meet the unreasonable sales goals.\n(78) A former Operating Committee member testified before the OCC that there came\na time when everybody at the Bank understood that the pressure that management applied on\nemployees to meet unreasonably high sales goals was too much.\n(79) Pressure on employees was exacerbated by stack ranking (which ranked from best\nto worst performing in sales), aggressive sales campaigns, and demoralizing and hazing\nmanagement techniques.\n19 (80) Sales performance data was available down to the individual employee and\nbranch level and was made available to all of Community Bank.\na. Management could track whether employees met their goals on a daily and real-\ntime basis.\n(81) The Board Report found that Community Bank\u2019s sales performance stack\nrankings, and its determination of employees\u2019 incentive compensation and promotional\nopportunities relative to sales goals, created \u201cintense pressure to perform . . . .\u201d\n(82) Besides being subject to the stress and fear of losing their jobs, employees were\nsubjected to a sales culture of intimidation and hazed by management to motivate them to meet\ntheir sales goals. The Community Bank implemented the following philosophy to drive sales\nresults: \u201cA whole bunch of management gurus say you need BHAGs \u2013 bold, hairy, audacious\ngoals. That\u2019s a technique of management \u2013 to give troops a goal that looks unattainable and flog\nthem heavily. And according to that line of thought, you will do better chasing a BHAG than you\nwill a reasonable objective.\u201d Management within the Community Bank implemented aggressive\n\u201cflogging\u201d techniques, including:\na. Running the \u201cgauntlet,\u201d wherein local managers were required to run between\nrows of their peers and announce their area\u2019s sales performance, subjecting them\nto criticism and ridicule if their performance was poor.\nb. Threatening direct reports with termination and other corrective actions for not\nmeeting the unreasonable sales goals: \u201c[y]ou struggle \u2013 you\u2019re gone.\u201d; \u201c[s]ome of\nyou truly need a miracle today to get back on track. Most of you should be\nembarrassed by your numbers. Your numbers ARE your measure of success-\ndon\u2019t fool yourselves. You are defined by your goal achievement. If you are\n20 afraid to produce because you think you\u2019re going to get fired, we have a much\nbigger problem.\u201d\nc. Warning employees that if they did not achieve sales goals, they would be\n\u201ctransferred to a store where someone had been shot and killed\u201d and if they did\nnot make enough appointments they would be \u201cforced to walk out in the hot sun\naround the block.\u201d\nd. Having multiple daily calls with management to discuss sales performance. Low\nperformers typically were called out in front of their peers and asked to explain\nhow they would improve their sales performance: \u201cBe adults and get your asses\non our calls. It\u2019s pathetic that I have to remind you all. And everyone se[ems] to\nhave an excuse. Go work at Walmart if you cannot handle any of the\naforementioned. Thank you.\u201d\n(83) From 2003 through 2013, the Community Bank promoted an annual sales\ncampaign known as \u201cJump into January,\u201d which ran from January through March of each year.\na. As part of this campaign, Community Bank imposed higher-than-normal sales\ngoals from January through March.\nb. The monthly sales goal during Jump into January was set as high as 12% of the\nyearly total.\nc. According to the Board Report, over time Jump into January became \u201ca breeding\nground for bad behavior . . . .\u201d\n(84) The pressure imposed on employees by Jump into January and the campaign\u2019s\nimpact on increased sales practices misconduct was widely known within the Community Bank.\nThe Bank had data capabilities to show a strong correlation between Jump into January and sales\n21 practices misconduct. Nonetheless, the Jump into January campaign continued until around\n2013.\n(85) The aggressive sales culture resulted in significant employee turnover,\napproximately 35% annually. The high turnover rate in the Community Bank indicated that sales\npressure was excessive and was driving employee separations.\na. The turnover rate in the retail branch network was significantly higher than in\npeer banks.\nb. Respondent Tolstedt and her management team justified the high turnover rate by\ncomparing it to that of retail companies like Macy\u2019s and Target rather than other\nbanks.\n(86) Employees remained under pressure to meet unreasonable sales goals until\nOctober 2016, when the sales goals in the Community Bank were officially eliminated. Only\nafter sales goals in the Community Bank were eliminated in October 2016 did the Bank issue\ninternal guidance stating that terminations for failure to meet sales goals would not be permitted.\nThe Controls Were Intentionally Designed to Prevent Detection of the Overwhelming\nMajority of Sales Practices Misconduct\n(87) For the entirety of the relevant period until the elimination of sales goals in\nOctober 2016, the Bank\u2019s controls related to sales practices were severely deficient in that they\nwere intentionally designed to neither prevent nor detect the vast majority of sales practices\nmisconduct.\n(88) Given the Community Bank\u2019s business model, every customer-facing employee\nhad both powerful motive and opportunity to engage in sales practices misconduct. The motive\narose from unreasonable goals and pressure to meet them; the opportunity was presented by\nBank systems that made it unlikely employees would be caught. First, the Bank\u2019s computer\n22 systems did not require evidence of customer consent when employees issued products and\nservices. Second, for most types of misconduct, an employee could only get caught for sales\npractices misconduct if another employee learned of the misconduct and blew the whistle, or if a\ncustomer became aware of the unauthorized products or services and complained. Only after\napproximately 2012 did the Bank begin monitoring a few types of sales practices misconduct,\nbut even then, employees were referred for investigation only if they engaged in sales practices\nmisconduct so frequently that they appeared on the Community Bank\u2019s list of the most egregious\noffenders (top 0.01 or top 0.05% of total offenders).\n(89) Despite knowing that sales practices misconduct was pervasive in the Community\nBank, Bank management had a disincentive to detect the majority of violators because doing so\nwould require additional terminations, expose the gravity of the misconduct, and undermine the\nnotion that sales practices misconduct was limited to a few \u201cbad apples.\u201d\n(90) Employees were much more likely to be disciplined or fired for failing to meet\ntheir sales goals\u2014against which they were tracked daily and measured in real time\u2014than for\nengaging in sales practices misconduct.\n(91) The Bank\u2019s Head of Corporate Investigations testified before the OCC\nthat there was nearly a 100% chance an employee\u2019s boss would know if she failed to meet her\nsales goals, but the chances were very small that an employee would be caught for issuing an\nunauthorized product or service. She testified:\nQ Okay. So if [employees] were doing it when nobody is\nwatching, and they don't do it enough to trigger the outlier\nthresholds that you've had, the chances of them getting caught is\nvery small?\nA Yes. I would agree.\n23 (92) There were four general mechanisms the Bank employed to detect sales practices\nmisconduct. Three were reactive tools that relied on employees or customers to surface\nproblems: 1) an employee complaint hotline known as the EthicsLine, 2) employee complaints\nsent directly to senior management or others within the Bank, and 3) customer complaints. The\nfourth tool involved using data analytics to detect activity indicative of sales practices\nmisconduct, referred to as \u201cproactive monitoring.\u201d The Bank did not employ proactive\nmonitoring until around 2012; before then, the only way the Bank detected sales practices\nmisconduct was if a customer or a Bank employee happened to report it.\n(93) Investigations of sales practices misconduct were also inexplicably limited. For\nexample, an employee accused of sales practices misconduct by a customer was only\ninvestigated in connection with a customer complaint if \u201cpolling\u201d of other customers of the same\nemployee revealed other similar incidents of misconduct.\n(94) The proactive monitoring instituted around 2012 was intentionally designed to\ncatch only a miniscule amount of sales practices misconduct.\na. The group within the Community Bank that performed proactive monitoring was\nknown as the Sales and Service Conduct Oversight Team (\u201cSSCOT\u201d). That team\nintentionally only flagged the most egregious offenders in sales practices\nmisconduct (top 0.01 or top 0.05%) for follow-up investigation.\n(95) The Bank could have lowered the thresholds for detecting sales practices\nmisconduct, but doing so would have resulted in the identification of additional illegal activity,\ninundating the Bank with investigations of employee misconduct and resulting in additional\nemployee terminations. The Bank did not want this outcome.\n24 (96) The former Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations testified\nbefore the OCC that Community Bank senior leadership \u201cabsolutely\u201d wanted to minimize\nterminations even if there was strong evidence that the employee engaged in sales practices\nmisconduct.\n(97) The Community Bank\u2019s proactive monitoring focused primarily on only two of\nthe many types of sales practices misconduct: simulated funding (unauthorized transfer of\ncustomer funds) and phone number changes (altering personal customer contact information in\nthe Bank\u2019s records). The Community Bank did not proactively monitor the many other types of\nsales practices misconduct, including pinning, bundling, sandbagging, and significantly, the\nissuance of unauthorized debit and credit cards.\n(98) In the summer and fall of 2013, SSCOT conducted an analysis to detect instances\nof simulated funding and of employees changing customer phone numbers without authorization\nin Los Angeles\/Orange County, and then across the regional footprint, using a screening\nmechanism to identify only the most egregious patterns of red flag sales activity. For example,\nfor conduct likely exhibiting simulated funding, SSCOT used criteria of 50 or more accounts in\nfive months or more than 10 percent of total accounts opened in four months, where the account\nwas funded with a single transfer of funds from an existing account to a new account, and then\ntransferred back to the originating accounts within one day, with no further activity in the new\naccount. The Bank effectively decided it would not investigate this red flag activity if it\nhappened 49 times, but only when it reached 50 instances. By contrast, if an employee missed\ntheir sales goal targets, Bank systems reported such results to managers, who were expected to\nfollow up with employees.\n25 (99) This analysis by SSCOT in the summer and fall of 2013 to identify only the most\negregious patterns of red flag sales activity for simulated funding and phone number changes led\nto an initial round of investigations that resulted in terminations of approximately 35 employees\nin the fall of 2013. Some of the terminated employees discussed the sales practices misconduct\nproblem with the Los Angeles Times.\n(100) In October 2013, the Los Angeles Times published an article under the headline,\n\u201cWells Fargo Fires Workers Accused of Cheating on Sales Goals.\u201d The article reported that the\nBank had fired 30 employees in the Los Angeles region for \u201copen[ing] accounts that were never\nused and attempt[ing] to manipulate customer-satisfaction surveys.\u201d The article further reported\nthat \u201cthe pressure to meet sales goals was intense\u201d and that there were cases of forged customer\nsignatures and accounts opened without customer knowledge.\n(101) In December 2013, the Los Angeles Times published a second article, with the\nheadline: \u201cWells Fargo\u2019s Pressure-Cooker Sales Culture Comes at a Cost.\u201d The article stated it\nwas based on interviews with 28 former and seven current employees across nine states. This\narticle reported that employees were threatened with termination if they failed to meet their sales\ngoals.\n(102) The Los Angeles Times articles about the Bank\u2019s sales culture and its impact on\nsales practices misconduct were well-known throughout the Bank and the Community Bank,\nincluding by Respondents.\n(103) Instead of increasing monitoring of sales practices misconduct, following the Los\nAngeles Times articles, the Community Bank paused proactive monitoring in an effort to limit\nthe large number of employee terminations for sales practices misconduct.\n26 a. Proactive monitoring, the only tool in effect at the Bank to proactively detect\nknown illegal activity and other misconduct, was paused from December 2013\nuntil approximately July 2014.\n(104) When SSCOT resumed proactive monitoring in July 2014, the Community\nBank\u2019s detection threshold identified only those employees in the 99.99% (top 0.01%) of activity\nthat was a \u201cred flag\u201d for simulated funding. The Bank literally could not have chosen a lower\nthreshold.\n(105) The effect of applying the 99.99% threshold was as follows: although\napproximately 30,000 employees per month exhibited activity that was a red flag for simulated\nfunding, which was just one of the many types of sales practices misconduct, SSCOT only\nreferred for investigation the top 0.01% of those employees, who had the most activity indicative\nof simulated funding, or an average of three employees per month. Put another way, while\n30,000 employees per month engaged in activity that was indicative of just one type of sales\npractices misconduct, the Bank decided to devote resources to investigate only three employees\nper month.\n(106) From April 2015 through October 2016, the Community Bank\u2019s thresholds were\nlowered slightly to detect employees in the 99.95th percentile of activity that was a red flag for\nsimulated funding. The Bank never set the threshold detection levels lower than this percentile.\na. Lowering the threshold monitoring criteria slightly to the 99.95th percentile\nresulted in the identification of approximately 15 to 18 employees per month.\n(107) The former Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations testified\nbefore the OCC that the number of employees terminated for sales practices misconduct was\nonly the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d because the Bank did little or no proactive monitoring.\n27 The Magnitude of Illegal Activity Over 14 Years was Immense\n(108) The Bank\u2019s Head of Corporate Investigations agreed that given the Community\nBank\u2019s business model and the controls that existed at the Bank, every customer-facing\nemployee had a daily temptation and opportunity to cheat. She testified before the OCC that\ngiven the amount of pressure that existed at the Bank, it would not be surprising \u201cthat there is\ngoing to be a high percentage of people that will cheat.\u201d\n(109) Over 14 years, hundreds of thousands of Community Bank employees succumbed\nto the intense pressure to perform and engaged in sales practices misconduct.\n(110) The former Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations\nillustrated the scope of the sales practices misconduct problem and the woefully inadequate\ncontrols in a 2013 email to a former Operating Committee member: \u201cAs you know, Sales\nIntegrity is a huge challenge.\u201d He went on to explain that in order to aid law enforcement, they\nestablished \u201ca few \u2018undercover\u2019 accounts, \u2026 but the accounts are not tied to a \u2018real\u2019 person.\nWithin 24 hours of the accounts being opened, two different community bank team members\nsaw them and ordered debit cards for the customers, attesting in the system that they had spoken\nto the customers. Geeeez. All I could do is shake my head.\u201d\n(111) The Community Bank\u2019s business model, and the sales practices misconduct it\ncaused, led to millions of products, services, and transactions that were unauthorized or sold as a\nresult of misrepresentation, and the firing of thousands of employees for failure to meet\nunreasonable sales goals.\n(112) In August 2017, Bank consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers (\u201cPwC\u201d) determined\nthat Bank employees opened approximately 3.5 million potentially unauthorized accounts\nbetween January 2009 and September 2016.\n28 (119) Even if the Bank was just as effective at identifying other types of sales practices\nmisconduct as it was simulated funding, it would mean that although the Bank terminated 5,300\nemployees for sales practices misconduct, hundreds of thousands of employees likely engaged in\nsuch misconduct.\nInaccurate and Misleading Reporting on the Sales Practices Misconduct Problem to the\nBoard and the OCC\n(120) Even after the Community Bank\u2019s sales practices misconduct problem became a\nnational news story in October and December 2013, Respondents in the Community Bank, the\nLaw Department, and Audit failed to take actions consistent with their respective responsibilities\nto identify, correct, and\/or escalate the sales practices misconduct problem.\n(121) The information reported in the Los Angeles Times articles in October and\nDecember 2013 reflected what Respondents already knew for years or should have known about\nthe sales practices misconduct problem and its root cause.\n(122) None of the Respondents ever escalated the 14-year sales practices misconduct\nproblem to the Board or the OCC.\n(123) In May 2015, the Los Angeles City Attorney filed suit against the Bank, alleging\nthat the Community Bank engaged in unlawful sales practices, including opening unauthorized\naccounts for customers, pinning, bundling, and sandbagging, to meet unrealistic sales goals,\nresulting in customer harm and violations of state consumer protection laws.\n(124) Even after Respondents Tolstedt and Russ Anderson were directed to inform the\nBoard and the OCC about the sales practices misconduct problem, they provided false,\nmisleading, and incomplete reporting on the root cause, duration, and scope of the problem, and\nthe adequacy of the controls.\n30 (125) In February 2015, the OCC commenced an examination of operational risk and\ncross-sell oversight within the Community Bank.\na. As a result of the examination, the OCC issued a Matter Requiring Attention\nrelated to sales practices to the Community Bank in April 2015.\nb. The OCC uses Matters Requiring Attention to communicate concern about a\nbank\u2019s deficient practices to a bank\u2019s board of directors and management.\nc. The sales practices Matter Requiring Attention found that the Community Bank\n\u201clack[ed] a formalized governance framework to oversee sales practices\u201d and\nwarned that the consequence of inaction included \u201cheightened reputation risk and\npossible negative publicity.\u201d\n(126) Respondent Tolstedt and her leadership team, including Respondent Russ\nAnderson, with assistance from the Law Department, prepared written materials for a meeting of\nthe Risk Committee of the Board covering sales practices on May 19, 2015 (\u201cMay 19, 2015\nMemo\u201d). The May 19, 2015 Memo was false, misleading, and incomplete.\na. For example, the May 19, 2015 Memo falsely ascribed the root cause of the sales\npractices misconduct problem to \u201cintentional team member misconduct based on\nthe fact that only a small percentage of Retail Banking team members engaged in\nthe outlier behavior.\u201d The materials did not reveal that \u201coutlier behavior\u201d referred\nto only the most egregious misconduct detected by applying the highly restrictive\n99.99 and 99.95% thresholds to only a limited set of misconduct.\nb. As another example, the May 19, 2015 Memo falsely stated that the Bank\u2019s\ncontrols were effective.\n31 (127) The same false, misleading, and incomplete materials were provided to the OCC\nduring its review of sales practices at the Bank.\n(128) In May 2015, when Respondent Tolstedt provided to the CEO for his review a\ndraft memorandum for the Risk Committee of the Board, the CEO advised that the committee\nwas interested in information on the number of products sold without customer consent and\ntermination figures. Nonetheless, despite the CEO\u2019s instructions, the final memorandum\nprovided to the Risk Committee of the Board and to the OCC omitted such key information that\nwould have aided in the Board\u2019s and the OCC\u2019s understanding of the magnitude of the sales\npractices misconduct problem.\n(129) The former CEO provided the following testimony before the OCC:\nQ Okay. Sitting here today, sir, do you agree that this [May\n19, 2015] memo misleads the Board, whether intentionally or not,\nit misleads the Board about the scope of the problem, the root\ncause of the problem, and the adequacy of the bank\u2019s controls.\nA I would agree with that.\n. . .\nQ Sir, we were discussing the May memo to the Board.\nWould you agree that, if that \u2013 since that May memo was also\npresented to the OCC, then that May memo was also misleading to\nthe OCC on the root cause, the extent of the problem, . . . and the\nadequacy of the bank\u2019s controls?\nA I would agree with that.\nThe Sales Practices Misconduct Problem was Resolved Only After Intense Congressional\nand Public Scrutiny\n(130) In June 2015, the OCC issued five new Matters Requiring Attention to the Bank\nrelated to sales practices risk management.\n(131) In July 2016, the OCC issued a Supervisory Letter to the Bank, concluding the\nBank had engaged in unsafe or unsound practices.\n32 (132) On September 8, 2016, the OCC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and\nthe Los Angeles City Attorney issued fines and penalties against the Bank related to sales\npractices misconduct, totaling $185 million. The OCC also issued a Consent Order requiring\ncorrective action and ordered the Bank to remediate customers who were harmed by the Bank\u2019s\nunsafe or unsound sales practices and to establish an enterprise-wide sales practices risk\nmanagement and oversight program to prevent and detect unsafe or unsound sales practices.\n(133) In the wake of the September 2016 actions, a former Operating Committee\nmember wrote the following about what the CEO should communicate to Bank employees:\n\u201cDon\u2019t: \u2026 Tout our culture. Something is broken. Do: Admit that we had an incentive\ncompensation system that was poorly designed, poorly monitored and managed and allowed to\nremain in place too long.\u201d\n(134) By October 2016, Operating Committee members, which then included\nRespondents Strother and Julian, held the following view: \u201cDon\u2019t say there was nothing wrong\nwith our culture. At least in the case of parts of the Community Bank, to suggest so just ignores a\nreality that everyone knows\u2026 there was insane pressure on people to produce \u2018widgets\u2019\/ new\naccount sales.\u201d\n(135) In October 2016, the Bank\u2014under intense pressure from the public and\nCongress\u2014finally eliminated sales goals for Community Bank employees, fundamentally\nchanging the decade-long business model on which it had been built.\n(136) In public testimony before the United States Senate Committee on Banking,\nHousing, and Urban Affairs in October 2017, CEO Sloan acknowledged that the sales and\nincentive plans in the Community Bank had been \u201cjust stupid.\u201d\n33 (137) Until sales goals were eliminated, however, Respondents Tolstedt and Russ\nAnderson continued to blame the sales practices misconduct problem on a small percent of \u201cbad\napple\u201d employees.\n(138) The Board Report criticized the Law Department and Audit regarding their\nhandling of sales practices misconduct, in addition to the Head of the Community Bank and the\nGroup Risk Officer of the Community Bank.\n(139) The former Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations testified\nbefore the OCC that \u201cit took an act of Congress for the company to change.\u201d\nARTICLE II\nTHE SALES PRACTICES MISCONDUCT PROBLEM RESULTED IN\nSERIOUS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY BY BANK EMPLOYEES\n(140) This Article repeats and realleges all Articles in this Notice.\n(141) Sales practices misconduct resulted in violations of criminal laws, including:\na. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 (misapplication of bank funds);\nb. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005 (false records);\nc. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7) (identity theft); and\nd. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(2) (bank fraud).\n(142) Sales practices misconduct resulted in violations of consumer laws and\nregulations, including:\na. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a) (Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices);\nb. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1030.4(a) (Regulation DD\/Truth in Savings); and\nc. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.12(a) (Regulation Z\/Truth in Lending).\n(143) Respondent Strother, the former General Counsel, testified before the OCC that\nopening unauthorized accounts or transferring customer funds without consent constitutes\n34 violations of numerous laws and regulations. He stated that \u201cfor sure it is [an] unfair and\ndeceptive practice . . . . There are laws in every state that prohibit that\u201d in addition to federal\nlaws. He also agreed that such practices constitute \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cfalsification of bank records.\u201d\n(144) Employees who engaged in simulated funding, which entails transferring\ncustomer funds from one account to another without customer consent, willfully misapplied\ncustomer funds with the intent to represent falsely in the Bank\u2019s systems that the account had\nbeen funded by the customer.\n(145) Employees who opened unauthorized accounts or issued unauthorized credit cards\nand debit cards made false representations in Bank systems to deceive the Bank about the\ncustomer\u2019s consent to open or issue the products. The false representations by employees\nenabled them to obtain benefits (or avoid negative consequences) for their managers or\nthemselves, including sales credit, improved performance management outcomes, and incentive\ncompensation.\na. In opening or issuing such unauthorized accounts or products, employees\nknowingly entered customer identification information, such as driver\u2019s license\ninformation, date of birth, or other data, in Bank computer systems without the\ncustomer\u2019s consent.\nb. To avoid disclosing the fact of an unauthorized account opening or an\nunauthorized credit card issuance, employees failed to provide customers with\nrequired account-opening disclosures.\n(146) Various forms of sales practices misconduct involved false representations by\nemployees in Bank systems that were intended to deceive the Bank into counting unauthorized\n35 accounts, services, or funds transfers as valid for purposes of sales credit, performance\nmanagement, and incentive compensation.\n(147) Employees engaged in sales practices misconduct made material\nmisrepresentations or omissions to consumers that were likely to mislead them about the\nproducts and services involved in the misconduct. Employees also engaged in acts or practices\nthat caused or were likely to cause substantial consumer injury that customers could not\nreasonably avoid.\nARTICLE III\nOPERATING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES FAILED\nTO FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, WHICH ENABLED THE SALES\nPRACTICES MISCONDUCT PROBLEM TO PERSIST\n(148) This Article repeats and realleges all Articles in this Notice.\n(149) The Bank had multiple policies and management committees that were designed\nto detect, address, and escalate the sales practices misconduct problem. These policies and\ncommittees entrusted Respondents Tolstedt, Russ Anderson, Strother, and Julian with the\nauthority and responsibility to address the sales practices misconduct problem. In reality, the\nRespondents did no such thing. These policies and committees, due to the actions and inactions\nof the Respondents who served on them, failed in all respects to address the sales practices\nmisconduct problem.\n(150) All incentive compensation plans at the Bank were required to comply with the\nBank\u2019s Incentive Compensation Risk Management Policy, adopted in 2011.\na. The Incentive Compensation Risk Management Policy imposed oversight\nresponsibilities on the Head of the Community Bank, the Community Bank Group\nRisk Officer, and the Law Department.\n36 (151) Respondents Tolstedt, Russ Anderson, Strother, and Julian served on important\nmanagement committees with responsibilities for identifying, managing, and escalating sales\npractices misconduct.\n(152) Respondents Strother and Julian were members of the Bank\u2019s Incentive\nCompensation Steering Committee, later renamed the Incentive Compensation Committee.\n(153) As Incentive Compensation Committee members, Respondents Strother and\nJulian were responsible for providing \u201coversight around the design and administration of the\nBusiness Line incentive plans, and lead[ing] Wells Fargo\u2019s enterprise efforts to enhance\nincentive compensation practices throughout the company.\u201d\n(154) Respondents Strother and Julian failed to fulfill their responsibilities on the\nIncentive Compensation Committee.\n(155) Respondents Strother and Julian were members of the Bank\u2019s Enterprise Risk\nManagement Committee.\na. As Enterprise Risk Management Committee members, Respondents Strother and\nJulian were responsible for \u201cunderstand[ing] and evaluat[ing] risk, address[ing]\nescalated issues, and provid[ing] active oversight of risk mitigation.\u201d Further, the\nEnterprise Risk Management Committee could escalate any issue to the Operating\nCommittee or the CEO, and reported quarterly to the Operating Committee and\nRisk Committee of the Board.\n(156) Respondents Strother and Julian failed to fulfill their responsibilities on the\nEnterprise Risk Management Committee.\n(157) Respondents Strother and Julian were members of the Team Member Misconduct\nExecutive Committee.\n37 a. The Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee charter states that the\n\u201ccommittee consists of senior executives who share responsibility for the\nappropriate management of team member misconduct and internal fraud matters\u201d\nand the \u201cCommittee was formed to look at issues more broadly across the\ncompany rather than individual situations.\u201d\nb. The purpose of the Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee was to\n\u201cprovide a forum for Wells Fargo executive management to provide leadership,\noversight and direction related to team member misconduct and internal fraud risk\nmanagement.\u201d\n(158) Respondents Strother and Julian failed to fulfill their responsibilities on the Team\nMember Misconduct Executive Committee.\n(159) Respondents Strother and Julian were members of the Ethics Committee.\na. The Ethics Committee was responsible for the content of the Code of Ethics and\noverseeing the policy and interpretation of the Code.\nb. The Code of Ethics contained a section on \u201cSales Incentive programs.\u201d\nc. Respondents Strother and Julian received reporting regarding increases in sales\nintegrity violations in Ethics Committee meetings.\n(160) Respondents Strother and Julian failed to fulfill their responsibilities on the Ethics\nCommittee.\n(161) Respondents Tolstedt and Russ Anderson were members of the Community Bank\nRisk Management Committee.\na. According to its charter, the primary responsibility of the Community Bank Risk\nManagement Committee was to understand the Community Bank\u2019s risk profile\n38 and \u201cto work with management across Community Banking to ensure risks are\nmanaged effectively.\u201d\n(162) Respondents Tolstedt and Russ Anderson failed to fulfill their responsibilities on\nthe Community Bank Risk Management Committee.\n(163) Sales practices misconduct, including trends and volumes, was a topic of\ndiscussion in meetings of the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, Team Member\nMisconduct Executive Committee, Ethics Committee, and the Community Bank Risk\nManagement Committee.\n(164) These committees provided their membership, including several Respondents, a\nrecurring source of information regarding sales practices misconduct in the Community Bank.\na. In 2011, sales practices misconduct was identified as a \u201ckey scenario\u201d for risk in\ntwo separate meeting packages for the Community Bank Risk Management\nCommittee.\nb. In February 2013, the Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee received\na presentation that showed that \u201csales integrity violations\u201d was the second-most\ncommon category of employee investigations.\nc. In August 2013, the Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee received\ndata that approximately half of the over 7,000 EthicsLine complaints investigated\nby Corporate Investigations related to sales integrity violations and that the\nnumber of sales integrity cases was increasing.\nd. The Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations reported in the\nAugust 2013 meeting of the Ethics Committee that \u201cSales Integrity issues are\n39 most prevalent \u2013 there needs to be continued focus in this area\u201d and that most\nEthicsLine reports are \u201cassociated with Sales Integrity Issues.\u201d\ne. In an April 9, 2014 Enterprise Risk Management Committee meeting, Community\nBank leadership informed the committee, including Respondents Strother and\nJulian, that one to two percent of Community Bank employees (1,000 to 2,000)\nwere terminated each year for sales practices-related wrongdoing.\n(165) Despite the information received about sales practices misconduct at these\ncommittee meetings, Respondents did not act to address the sales practices misconduct problem\nconsistent with their responsibilities.\nARTICLE IV\nTHE SALES PRACTICES MISCONDUCT PROBLEM RESULTED IN SERIOUS\nFINANCIAL HARM AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO THE BANK\n(166) This Article repeats and realleges all Articles in this Notice.\n(167) The sales practices misconduct problem caused enormous and ongoing financial\nlosses and other damage to the Bank.\n(168) A former CEO of the Company estimated the total financial impact of sales\npractices misconduct on the Company and Bank to be in the \u201ctens of billions of dollars.\u201d\n(169) The Bank agreed to settlements totaling $185 million with the OCC, Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, and Los Angeles City Attorney.\n(170) The independent directors of the Board retained a law firm to conduct an\ninvestigation of sales practices misconduct at the Bank. The Bank has paid the law firm more\nthan $70 million in connection with its representation of the independent directors in matters\nrelated to sales practices, including the investigation.\n40 (171) The Bank has also paid more than $97 million to consultants in connection with\nsales practices matters.\n(172) The Bank instituted a voluntary mediation program related to sales practices\nissues, and has paid more than $13 million in expenses.\n(173) On June 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\napproved a $142 million settlement in a class action lawsuit for all individuals in whose name the\nBank opened an unauthorized account or submitted an unauthorized application, among other\nthings.\n(174) Sales practices misconduct has also resulted in other damage, including\ndowngraded credit ratings, reduced shareholder return, and reputational harm.\n(175) In 2017, the Bank fell to last place in a bank reputation survey conducted by\nAmerican Banker\/Reputation Institute. According to the American Banker, the Bank\u2019s reputation\nscore \u201cwent into freefall . . . [and was] by far the lowest of any bank.\u201d\n(176) In explaining how the Bank\u2019s sales practices misconduct problem \u201cso clearly\nharmed [the Bank\u2019s] reputation,\u201d a former CEO of the Bank testified before the OCC: \u201cWell,\nprior to [the sales practices scandal], Wells Fargo had a very stellar reputation in terms of serving\nour customers, serving all of our stakeholders. And because of the mistakes that we made related\nto sales practices, we saw significant criticism on the part of a number of those stakeholders.\u201d\n(177) The Bank\u2019s sales practices have been the subject of unflattering news reports in\nthe years after the Los Angeles Times articles and the settlements.\na. In September 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that \u201c[m]anagers suggested\nto employees that they hunt for sales prospects at bus stops and retirement homes\n. . . .\u201d\n41 b. The Chicago Tribune ran a story in October 2016 that reported an employee \u201cand\n[his] colleagues seized every opportunity to open sham accounts for Latinos,\nmany of them recent immigrants.\u201d\nc. In November 2017, the Financial Times published a special report on the Bank\u2019s\nsales practices in which one former employee admitted \u201che found himself\nroaming the aisles at Petco, the animal-supplies store, trying to persuade dog-\ngrooming specialists to sign up for small-business services.\u201d\n(178) In 2018, the Bank launched a marketing campaign called \u201cRe-Established,\u201d to\nrehabilitate its reputation from the negative effects of sales practices misconduct.\n(179) The \u201cRe-Established\u201d marketing campaign cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n(180) Credit rating agencies have downgraded the Bank\u2019s rating and outlook due, in\npart, to sales practices misconduct.\n(181) The sales practices misconduct problem has negatively affected the Company\u2019s\nstock price.\n(182) Whereas peer institutions\u2019 stock prices\u2014and the broader stock market\u2014have\nexperienced over 10 percent growth since the sales practices settlements on September 8, 2016,\nthe Company\u2019s stock price has seen little or no growth.\n(183) The Bank continues to experience financial and reputational harm related to sales\npractices misconduct.\n(184) In August 2019, the Company estimated in a quarterly securities filing that it\ncould face $3.9 billion in additional losses from potential legal action related to sales practices\nmisconduct and other issues.\n42 (185) In fourth quarter 2019, the Bank disclosed a \u201c$1.6 billion discrete litigation\naccrual (not tax deductible) for previously disclosed retail sales practices matters.\u201d\nARTICLE V\nRESPONDENT TOLSTEDT VIOLATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS, RECKLESSLY\nENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES, AND BREACHED HER\nFIDUCIARY DUTY\n(186) This Article repeats and realleges all Articles in this Notice.\n(187) Respondent Tolstedt was the Head of the Community Bank and an Operating\nCommittee member from 2007 until July 2016.\n(188) From approximately 2002 until 2007, Respondent Tolstedt was the Community\nBank\u2019s Head of Regional Banking, responsible for the Community Bank\u2019s retail branch network.\n(189) From 2007 to 2016, Respondent Tolstedt reported to the CEO.\n(190) Respondent Tolstedt was a member of the Bank\u2019s Board from at least 2006\nthrough 2014.\n(191) Following Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s resignation, the Bank\u2019s Board terminated her for\ncause in 2017 in connection with her role in the sales practices misconduct problem in the\nCommunity Bank.\n(192) Respondent Tolstedt was an \u201cinstitution-affiliated party\u201d of the Bank as that term\nis defined in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(u), having served in such capacity within six (6) years from the\ndate hereof (see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(i)(3)).\n(193) The OCC is the \u201cappropriate Federal banking agency\u201d as that term is defined in\n12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(q) and is authorized to initiate and maintain these prohibition and civil money\npenalty actions against Respondent Tolstedt pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(e) and (i).\n43 Respondent Tolstedt is Directly and Significantly Responsible for the Community Bank\u2019s\nBusiness Model that Incentivized Systemic Sales Practices Misconduct for Over a Decade\n(194) During Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s sworn testimony before the OCC, she asserted her\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to answer all substantive\nquestions, including those related to the allegations in this Article.\n(195) Respondent Tolstedt was the leader of the Community Bank or its retail branch\nnetwork during the entirety of the sales practices misconduct problem.\n(196) Respondent Tolstedt is significantly responsible for the systemic sales practices\nmisconduct problem that existed in the Community Bank for at least 14 years.\n(197) Respondent Tolstedt developed, implemented, promoted, and enforced the\nCommunity Bank\u2019s business model.\n(198) The Community Bank\u2019s business model imposed unreasonable sales goals on its\nemployees, along with unreasonable pressure to meet such goals.\n(199) The business model incentivized and caused hundreds of thousands of\nCommunity Bank employees to engage in sales practices misconduct.\n(200) Under the Bank\u2019s Incentive Compensation Risk Management Policy, Respondent\nTolstedt was accountable for all incentive compensation outcomes in the Community Bank.\na. The Incentive Compensation Risk Management Policy also required Respondent\nTolstedt to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements appropriately\nbalanced risk and reward.\n(201) Respondent Tolstedt failed to fulfill her responsibilities under the Incentive\nCompensation Risk Management Policy.\n(202) Respondent Tolstedt was responsible for effective risk management in the\nCommunity Bank.\n44 (203) During the entirety of Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s leadership, the Community Bank\u2019s\ncontrols were intentionally designed neither to prevent nor detect the vast majority of sales\npractices misconduct.\n(204) From no later than 2002 through 2016, Respondent Tolstedt knew that the\nCommunity Bank\u2019s business model incentivized illegal sales practices misconduct.\n(205) By 2003, Respondent Tolstedt recognized the Community Bank\u2019s sales plan as\n\u201cvery, very aggressive.\u201d She stated in an email: \u201c[w]e think instead of 50-50 plan (50% not\nmeeting and 50% exceeding with some reasonable distribution), we have a 35%-65% plan or\n35% chance of exceeding and 65% going under plan. AND, we debated whether this was a 25-75\nplan so you can see we have been aggressive.\u201d\n(206) Despite continued warnings from senior regional leaders, Corporate\nInvestigations, and Bank employees about ongoing sales practices misconduct across the\nCommunity Bank and its root cause, Respondent Tolstedt demanded double-digit annual sales\ngrowth and required regions to grow cross-sell, which entailed selling additional products and\nservices to existing customers.\n(207) Under Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s direction, between 2004 and 2012, the Community\nBank almost always increased its sales goals by greater than 10 percent annually.\n(208) Respondent Tolstedt knew that the increases in sales goals every year were based\non the prior year\u2019s sales performance, or \u201crun rate,\u201d which was tainted by sales practices\nmisconduct.\n(209) Under Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s direction, the Community Bank implemented a\ncampaign known as \u201cJump into January,\u201d which led to increased sales pressure, including\ndenying employees the use of any personal time off, calling employees multiple times a day to\n45 check on sales numbers, and requiring employees to stay late or work additional days to meet\ntheir goals.\n(210) Despite receiving ongoing information about sales practices misconduct caused\nby unreasonable pressure to meet the unreasonable sales goals, Respondent Tolstedt resisted any\nmeaningful changes to the Community Bank\u2019s business model.\na. Respondent Tolstedt continued to emphasize sales and cross-sell growth in the\nface of increasing sales practices misconduct.\nb. Respondent Tolstedt accepted only marginal and incremental changes to the sales\ngoals and incentive compensation plans.\nc. In 2015, Respondent Tolstedt objected to the elimination of sales goals in the\nCommunity Bank.\nd. The root cause of sales practices misconduct in the Community Bank\u2019s business\nmodel was not addressed until the elimination of sales goals in October 2016,\nafter Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s departure from the Bank.\n(211) Respondent Tolstedt failed to properly supervise Community Bank management,\nincluding leaders who imposed unreasonable pressure on employees to meet unreasonable sales\ngoals.\n(212) Respondent Tolstedt never removed the threat of termination for employees\u2019\nfailure to meet the unreasonable sales goals.\n(213) In contrast, Respondent Tolstedt continually sought to limit the number of\nterminations for sales practices misconduct, but made no similar effort to reduce terminations for\nnot meeting unreasonable sales goals.\n46 (214) Throughout her tenure, Respondent Tolstedt did not initiate efforts by the\nCommunity Bank to remediate the harm caused to customers by sales practices misconduct.\n(215) As stated in the Board Report: \u201c[t]here is no evidence that Tolstedt showed\nserious concern about the effects of improper sales practices on Wells Fargo\u2019s customers or that\nshe initiated efforts to evaluate or remediate customer harm.\u201d\n(216) While serving as the Head of the Community Bank, Respondent Tolstedt had the\nauthority to fully address and eliminate sales practices misconduct within the Community Bank.\nShe failed to do so during the entirety of her tenure in her role.\nRespondent Tolstedt Downplayed the Severity of the Sales Practices Misconduct Problem\nand Provided False and Misleading Reporting about the Problem to the Board and the\nOCC\n(217) Not only did Respondent Tolstedt fail to address and escalate systemic sales\npractices misconduct, she downplayed its seriousness and scope and actively discouraged and\nobjected to the reporting of information related to sales practices misconduct to the Enterprise\nRisk Management Committee, the Board, and the OCC.\n(218) Respondent Tolstedt blamed individual employees for the sales practices\nmisconduct problem and refused to acknowledge the unreasonable sales goals as the root cause\nof the problem.\n(219) Respondent Tolstedt found it acceptable that the Community Bank terminated\napproximately 1,000 employees for sales practices misconduct every year.\n(220) When forced to present on sales practices to the Board, Respondent Tolstedt\nprovided false, misleading, and incomplete information about all aspects of the sales practices\nmisconduct problem.\n47 (221) Respondent Tolstedt first presented to the Board on sales practices on or around\nApril 28, 2015, and only after being so directed.\na. During the April 2015 presentation, Respondent Tolstedt failed to inform the Risk\nCommittee of the Board about critical aspects of the sales practices misconduct\nproblem.\nb. For example, Respondent Tolstedt failed to inform the Risk Committee that the\nsales practices misconduct problem was widespread, and failed to inform the\nCommittee of its root cause, duration, and scope.\n(222) The former Chair of the Risk Committee of the Board testified that Respondent\nTolstedt\u2019s April 2015 presentation \u201cwent very poorly. It did not address what I had asked to be\naddressed . . . What is the scope and substance of the sales practice issue? And in this meeting,\nTolstedt presented all these belts and suspenders and efforts to ensure that misdeeds would not\noccur. And that wasn\u2019t the question. . . . we walked away from there no better informed than\nwhen we walked in about the scope and substance [of the problem.]\u201d\n(223) On or around May 4, 2015, the Los Angeles City Attorney filed a lawsuit against\nthe Bank regarding sales practices.\n(224) The Risk Committee of the Board directed Tolstedt to make another presentation\non sales practices in May 2015.\n(225) Respondent Tolstedt was directly involved in preparing the May 19, 2015 Memo\nand supervised its preparation.\n(226) The verbal and written information regarding sales practices that Respondent\nTolstedt supplied to the Risk Committee of the Board for the May 19, 2015 meeting was false,\nmisleading, and incomplete.\n48 a. During the May 2015 presentation to the Risk Committee of the Board,\nRespondent Tolstedt again failed to inform the Committee about critical aspects\nof the sales practices misconduct problem.\nb. For example, Respondent Tolstedt failed to inform the Risk Committee that the\nsales practices misconduct problem was widespread, and failed to inform the\nCommittee of its root cause, duration, and scope.\n(227) The false, misleading, and incomplete May 19, 2015 Memo that accompanied the\nMay 2015 presentation to the Risk Committee of the Board was provided to the OCC.\n(228) The Board Report found: \u201c[b]y 2015, many Board members believed that\n[Respondent Tolstedt] was intentionally understating the problem which she had helped to\ncreate.\u201d\n(229) Respondent Tolstedt allowed her team to provide false, misleading, and\nincomplete information about sales practices misconduct to the OCC during the course of its\nexaminations of sales practices.\n(230) Respondent Tolstedt never informed the Board about the inadequate controls to\nprevent and detect sales practices misconduct.\n(231) Respondent Tolstedt never informed the OCC about the inadequate controls to\nprevent and detect sales practices misconduct.\n(232) Respondent Tolstedt attended a full Board meeting held on or around June 23,\n2015. In that meeting, the Chair of the Risk Committee of the Board stated: \u201cthe Risk\nCommittee\u2019s focus includes the motivating factors for team members who may have engaged in\nimproper conduct, compliance implications . . . \u201d Respondent Tolstedt failed to inform the Board\n49 that unreasonable pressure to meet unreasonable sales goals motivated employees to engage in\nsales practices misconduct.\n(233) A former Operating Committee member asked Respondent Tolstedt to present at\na Board meeting to be held on or around October 26-27, 2015 regarding sales practices.\nRespondent Tolstedt resisted the request and asked if she would be fired if she did not present to\nthe Board.\n(234) Respondent Tolstedt ultimately did present at the Board meeting held on or\naround October 26-27, 2015. At this meeting, she failed again to inform the Board about critical\naspects of the sales practices misconduct problem. She failed to inform the Board that the sales\npractices misconduct problem was widespread, and failed to inform the Board of its root cause,\nduration, and scope.\n(235) In testimony before the OCC, the former Chair of the Risk Committee of the\nBoard described Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s presentation to the Board in October 2015 as follows:\n\u201cmy personal reaction was that it was kind of as if it was some sort of a nuanced change[] that\nneeded to take place within the Community Bank to affect the appropriate practices as opposed\nto this is really a serious issue. There was no recognition within those remarks of the extent or\nseriousness of the matter. So I had a very negative personal reaction. . . . I just said [Respondent\nTolstedt\u2019s presentation] was \u2013 well, excuse my language. I think I had called it a piece of shit.\u201d\n(236) Despite knowledge to the contrary, at no point in any of her presentations to the\nBoard did Respondent Tolstedt attribute the sales practices misconduct problem to the\nCommunity Bank\u2019s business model.\n(237) Despite knowledge to the contrary, at no point in any of her presentations to the\nBoard did Respondent Tolstedt attribute the sales practices misconduct problem to the\n50 unreasonable pressure, unreasonable sales goals, employees\u2019 fear of termination for not meeting\nthe unreasonable sales goals, and the inadequate controls for preventing and detecting the\nmisconduct.\n(238) At no point in any of the Community Bank\u2019s reporting to the OCC on sales\npractices did Respondent Tolstedt or her subordinates attribute the sales practices misconduct\nproblem to unreasonable sales goals, unreasonable pressure, employees\u2019 fear of termination for\nnot meeting the unreasonable sales goals, and the inadequate controls for preventing and\ndetecting the misconduct.\n* * *\n(239) By reason of Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s misconduct, the OCC seeks a Prohibition\nOrder against Respondent Tolstedt pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(e) on the following grounds:\na. Respondent Tolstedt violated laws and regulations, including: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 656,\n1005, 1028(a)(7), 1344(2); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1030.4(a) (Regulation\nDD\/Truth in Savings) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.12(a) (Regulation Z\/Truth in\nLending); engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the affairs of the\nBank; and breached her fiduciary duties to the Bank;\nb. By reason of Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s misconduct, the Bank suffered financial loss\nor other damage; Respondent Tolstedt received financial gain or other benefit;\nand Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s misconduct prejudiced the interests of depositors; and\nc. Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s violations of laws and regulations, unsafe or unsound\npractices, and breaches of fiduciary duties involved personal dishonesty and\ndemonstrated a willful or continuing disregard for the safety or soundness of the\nBank.\n51 (240) By reason of Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s misconduct, the OCC assesses a civil money\npenalty against Respondent Tolstedt pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(i) on the following grounds:\na. Respondent Tolstedt violated laws and regulations, including: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 656,\n1005, 1028(a)(7), 1344(2); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1030.4(a) and 12\nC.F.R. \u00a7 1026.12(a); recklessly engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in\nconducting the affairs of the Bank; and breached her fiduciary duties to the Bank;\nb. Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s violations, practices, and breaches of her fiduciary duties\nwere part of a pattern of misconduct, resulted in pecuniary gain or other benefit to\nher, and caused more than minimal loss to the Bank.\nARTICLE VI\nRESPONDENT RUSS ANDERSON VIOLATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS,\nRECKLESSLY ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES, AND\nBREACHED HER FIDUCIARY DUTY TO THE BANK\n(241) This Article repeats and realleges all Articles in this Notice.\n(242) Respondent Russ Anderson served as the Community Bank\u2019s Group Risk Officer\nfrom 2004 until August 2016. Respondent Russ Anderson reported to Respondent Tolstedt from\n2006 through 2015.\n(243) In or around February 2017, Respondent was terminated for cause in connection\nwith her role in the sales practices misconduct problem in the Community Bank.\n(244) During Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s sworn testimony before the OCC, she\nasserted her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to answer all\nsubstantive questions, including those related to the allegations in this Article.\n52 (245) Respondent Russ Anderson was an \u201cinstitution-affiliated party\u201d of the Bank as\nthat term is defined in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(u), having served in such capacity within six (6) years\nfrom the date hereof (see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(i)(3)).\n(246) The OCC is the \u201cappropriate Federal banking agency\u201d as that term is defined in\n12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(q) and is authorized to initiate and maintain these prohibition and civil money\npenalty actions against Respondent Russ Anderson pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(e) and (i).\nRespondent Russ Anderson Failed in Her Responsibilities as Group Risk Officer\n(247) As the Community Bank\u2019s Group Risk Officer, Respondent Russ Anderson led\nthe first line of defense in the Community Bank with responsibility for risk management and\ncontrols, including with respect to sales practices.\n(248) Respondent Russ Anderson failed to fulfill her responsibilities as Group Risk\nOfficer with respect to the sales practices misconduct problem.\n(249) Respondent Russ Anderson knew that the Community Bank\u2019s business model\u2014\nplacing unreasonable pressure on employees to meet unattainable sales goals\u2014was the root\ncause of the sales practices misconduct problem, and understood that employees engaged in sales\npractices misconduct to maintain their employment.\na. By February 2013, Respondent Russ Anderson could not identify any midlevel to\nsenior leader in the Community Bank who had both \u201cgood sales production\u201d and\neither good or significantly improved sales quality.\n(250) Respondent Russ Anderson also understood that the sales practices misconduct\nproblem could result in millions of dollars in losses to the Bank, as well as other harm such as\nloss of trust and confidence and loss of revenue.\n53 (251) Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s failures as the Group Risk Officer enabled sales\npractices misconduct to persist.\n(252) Respondent Russ Anderson failed to ensure the Community Bank addressed the\nsales practices misconduct problem and its root cause, and failed to escalate and accurately\nreport the problem and its root cause to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, the Board,\nand the OCC.\n(253) Under the Incentive Compensation Risk Management Policy, Respondent Russ\nAnderson had \u201cto provide independent reviews of incentive compensation arrangements and\nbalancing features used\u201d and was \u201caccountable to Wells Fargo\u2019s Chief Risk Officer to ensure\nappropriate balance is achieved.\u201d\n(254) Respondent Russ Anderson failed to fulfill her responsibilities under the Incentive\nCompensation Risk Management Policy.\n(255) Respondent sponsored and was a member of the Community Bank\u2019s Risk\nManagement Committee, which was responsible for \u201cwork[ing] with management across\nCommunity Banking to ensure risks are managed effectively.\u201d\n(256) Respondent failed to fulfill her responsibilities on this committee.\n(257) The Board Report concluded that \u201cRuss Anderson\u2019s performance fell far short of\nwhat was expected and required of the senior risk officer in the Community Bank.\u201d\nRespondent Russ Anderson Failed to Ensure the Community Bank\u2019s Controls were\nReasonably Designed to Prevent and Detect Sales Practices Misconduct\n(258) Respondent Russ Anderson was responsible for the Community Bank\u2019s controls.\n(259) By 2007 at the latest, Respondent Russ Anderson knew or should have known\nthat lack of customer consent for products was a primary sales integrity issue, but she\n54 nevertheless failed to ensure throughout her tenure as Group Risk Officer that the Community\nBank had adequate controls to capture customer consent for Bank products.\n(260) SSCOT, the group within the Community Bank responsible for detecting sales\npractices misconduct and conducting proactive monitoring, reported to Respondent Russ\nAnderson from January 2012 through 2016.\n(261) Respondent Russ Anderson failed to ensure the Community Bank\u2019s controls,\nincluding SSCOT\u2019s proactive monitoring, were reasonably designed to prevent and detect sales\npractices misconduct.\n(262) Respondent Russ Anderson agreed to a six-month pause of SSCOT\u2019s proactive\nmonitoring of sales practices misconduct in 2013 and 2014.\n(263) Respondent Russ Anderson thereafter approved SSCOT\u2019s use of proactive\nmonitoring thresholds designed to identify only the most egregious violators who engaged in\nsales practices misconduct.\n(264) The former head of the Bank\u2019s Financial Crimes Risk Management department\ntestified before the OCC that he informed Respondent Russ Anderson that applying restrictive\nmonitoring thresholds only managed the number of employees identified, as opposed to\nmanaging sales practices risk itself. He testified that Russ Anderson responded: \u201cif [SSCOT]\nchanged or dramatically changed their monitoring thresholds that they would have \u2026 many,\nmany more identified team members than they could reasonably handle.\u201d\n(265) Respondent Russ Anderson resisted suggestions by others to broaden the\nrestrictive thresholds for simulated funding and phone number changes.\n55 (266) Respondent Russ Anderson failed to ensure the Community Bank proactively\nmonitored other types of known sales practices misconduct, such as pinning, bundling,\nsandbagging, and significantly, the issuance of unauthorized debit and credit cards.\n(267) The former Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations testified\nbefore the OCC that he specifically advised Respondent Russ Anderson that the number of\nemployees caught and terminated for sales practices misconduct was just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d\nbecause of the lack of robust proactive monitoring.\nRespondent Russ Anderson Failed to Escalate and Accurately Report the Sales Practices\nMisconduct Problem and its Root Cause to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee\nand the Board\n(268) Respondent Russ Anderson failed to escalate and accurately report the\nCommunity Bank\u2019s sales practices misconduct problem and its root cause to the Enterprise Risk\nManagement Committee and the Board.\n(269) The Board Report found that Respondent Russ Anderson \u201cexhibited a lack of\ntransparency and failed to escalate sales integrity issues and related terminations to Wells\nFargo\u2019s Board of Directors and the [Enterprise Risk Management Committee]\u201d and \u201cminimized\nand obscured issues in reporting on the Community Bank, including sales practices.\u201d\n(270) Respondent Russ Anderson presented to the Enterprise Risk Management\nCommittee on April 9, 2014.\n(271) At the April 9, 2014 Enterprise Risk Management Committee meeting,\nRespondent Russ Anderson told the committee that:\na. the Community Bank\u2019s business model did not incent inappropriate behavior;\nb. \u201cmanagement tries to stress a balanced message of sales, service, and quality\u201d;\nand\n56 c. \u201cthe Sales Quality team looks at a manager\u2019s track record prior to an individual\nbeing promoted.\u201d\nd. Those representations were false or misleading.\n(272) Despite knowledge to the contrary, Respondent Russ Anderson failed to inform\nthe Enterprise Risk Management Committee that the Community Bank\u2019s business model was the\nroot cause of the sales practices misconduct problem.\n(273) Respondent Russ Anderson failed to inform the Enterprise Risk Management\nCommittee that she was unable to identify any midlevel to senior leader in the Community Bank\nwho maintained both \u201cgood sales production\u201d and either good or significantly improved sales\nquality, despite having this knowledge in February 2013.\n(274) The Board Report found that Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s April 9, 2014\npresentation to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee \u201cdid not provide a forthright\ndescription and assessment of the [sales practices misconduct] problem.\u201d\n(275) Respondent Russ Anderson assisted in preparing the May 19, 2015 Memo to the\nRisk Committee of the Board, which was also provided to the OCC.\n(276) Respondent Russ Anderson knew the May 19, 2015 Memo contained false,\nmisleading, and incomplete information about critical aspects of sales practices misconduct in\nthe Community Bank, including the root cause of the problem, its scope, and the adequacy of\ncontrols (which the May 19, 2015 Memo falsely described as \u201crobust\u201d).\n(277) Respondent Russ Anderson failed to correct the false, misleading, and incomplete\ninformation in the May 19, 2015 Memo.\n(278) Instead, Respondent Russ Anderson successfully advocated for the removal of\nmaterial employee termination data related to sales practices misconduct from the memo.\n57 Respondent Russ Anderson Made False and Misleading Statements to the OCC\n(279) Respondent Russ Anderson knowingly and willfully made several false and\nmisleading statements to OCC examiners during the February 2015 and May 2015 examinations\nand regularly sought to limit the extent of information the Bank provided to the OCC.\n(280) On April 4, 2014, Corporate Risk provided feedback on Respondent Russ\nAnderson\u2019s written presentation to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, requesting more\ncontent on the \u201ccurrent state\u201d of sales practices. Respondent Russ Anderson responded that she\nwas \u201cworried about putting something like that into a deck. I\u2019d rather we did that verbally\nbecause this deck is subject to the regulators [sic] review.\u201d\n(281) Respondent Russ Anderson participated in a February 10, 2015 conference call\nwith the OCC (\u201cFebruary 2015 OCC Call\u201d).\n(282) On the February 2015 OCC Call, an OCC examiner asked whether pressure to\nmeet baseline sales goals was significant and contributed to employee turnover. Respondent\nRuss Anderson told the OCC that \u201cno one loses their job because they did not meet sales goals.\u201d\n(283) Respondent Russ Anderson also told OCC examiners on the February 2015 OCC\nCall \u201cthat customers are not cross-sold any products without first going through a formal needs\nassessment discussion with a banker,\u201d suggesting that all products were sold with customer\nconsent.\n(284) On April 9, 2015, in response to a question from another Community Bank leader\nregarding what information to include in a submission to the Risk Committee of the Board,\nRespondent Russ Anderson stated that she \u201cwould not add anything more than what we have in\nthe document. We\u2019re still forming and storming and since this document will also go to the\nOCC[,] I would prefer we keep it to a minimum.\u201d\n58 (285) In April 2015, an SSCOT manager who reported directly to Respondent Russ\nAnderson shared with her Facebook posts from a former Bank branch manager. The posts stated:\n\u201c[Wells Fargo management] have created a toxic atmosphere of sales goals that forces\nemployees to sell products [customers] don\u2019t want. They literally say \u2018every customer needs a\ncredit card.\u2019 . . . If there is ever a company as disgusting and unethical as this one, I dare you to\nfind it.\u201d\n(286) The next month, Respondent Russ Anderson participated in a May 14, 2015\nmeeting with the OCC (\u201cMay 2015 OCC Meeting\u201d).\n(287) Respondent Russ Anderson told examiners during the May 2015 OCC Meeting\nthat interviews with employees \u201cdid not lead to conclusions about sales pressure,\u201d that she does\nnot \u201chear\u201d about pressure from personal bankers \u201cat all,\u201d and that \u201cpeople are positive and\npleased.\u201d\n(288) Respondent Russ Anderson also told examiners during the May 2015 OCC\nMeeting that the \u201c[m]ost important thing is we found something, we were proactive, we did\nsomething, and the preponderance were non-customer impact.\u201d\n(289) Respondent Russ Anderson continued to instruct her staff after these meetings to\nlimit the information provided to the OCC regarding sales practices.\na. For example, in June 2015, the Bank was in the process of compiling information\nfor the OCC on the topic of capturing customer consent for Bank products.\nAlthough her staff advised her that the OCC requested information regarding\nsignature requirements for deposit products, on June 24, 2015 Respondent Russ\nAnderson commented in an email that the OCC \u201cdid not ask about deposits and\n59 we shouldn\u2019t add it. I'll edit it out when they [Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s staff]\nsend it.\u201d\n(290) Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s false and misleading statements and other conduct\nobstructed the OCC\u2019s examinations of the Bank.\n* * *\n(291) By reason of Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s misconduct, the OCC seeks a\nProhibition Order against Respondent Russ Anderson pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(e) on the\nfollowing grounds:\na. Respondent Russ Anderson violated laws and regulations, including: 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 656, 1001(a) (false statements), 1005, 1028(a)(7), 1344(2), 1517 (obstruction\nof a bank examination); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1030.4(a) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\n1026.12(a); engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the affairs of\nthe Bank; and breached her fiduciary duties to the Bank;\nb. By reason of Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s misconduct, the Bank suffered\nfinancial loss or other damage; Respondent Russ Anderson received financial gain\nor other benefit; and Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s misconduct prejudiced the\ninterests of depositors; and\nc. Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s violations of laws and regulations, unsafe or\nunsound practices, and breaches of fiduciary duties involved personal dishonesty\nand demonstrated a willful or continuing disregard for the safety or soundness of\nthe Bank.\n60 (292) By reason of Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s misconduct, the OCC assesses a civil\nmoney penalty against Respondent Russ Anderson pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(i) on the\nfollowing grounds:\na. Respondent Russ Anderson violated laws and regulations, including: 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 656, 1001(a), 1005, 1028(a)(7), 1344(2), 1517; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a); 12 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1030.4(a) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.12(a); recklessly engaged in unsafe or unsound\npractices in conducting the affairs of the Bank; and breached her fiduciary duties\nto the Bank;\nb. Respondent Russ Anderson\u2019s violations, practices, and breaches of her fiduciary\nduties were part of a pattern of misconduct, resulted in pecuniary gain or other\nbenefit to her, and caused more than minimal loss to the Bank.\nARTICLE VII\nRESPONDENT STROTHER RECKLESSLY ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR\nUNSOUND PRACTICES AND BREACHED HIS FIDUCIARY DUTY\n(293) This Article repeats and realleges all Articles in this Notice.\n(294) Respondent Strother served as General Counsel and a member of the Operating\nCommittee from 2004 until his retirement in March 2017.\n(295) From 2008 through 2016, Respondent Strother reported to the CEO.\n(296) Respondent Strother was an \u201cinstitution-affiliated party\u201d of the Bank as that term\nis defined in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(u), having served in such capacity within six (6) years from the\ndate hereof (see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(i)(3)).\n(297) The OCC is the \u201cappropriate Federal banking agency\u201d as that term is defined in\n12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(q) and is authorized to initiate and maintain these cease and desist and civil\nmoney penalty actions against Respondent Strother pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(b) and (i).\n61 (298) As General Counsel, Respondent Strother was the principal legal advisor for the\nBank and was responsible for:\na. ensuring the Bank complied with laws and regulations, operated in a safe and\nsound manner, and maintained controls reasonably designed to prevent and detect\nmisconduct;\nb. supervising and managing the activities of the Law Department; and\nc. escalating to senior management and the Board risk issues that could impact the\nBank\u2019s compliance with laws and regulations and safety and soundness\nrequirements.\n(299) From the beginning of Respondent Strother\u2019s tenure as General Counsel in 2004\nuntil the Bank\u2019s elimination of sales goals in October 2016, Community Bank employees\nengaged in repeated, pervasive, and widespread illegal conduct in order to meet unreasonable\nsales goals and maintain their jobs. The Law Department knew of this conduct for the entirety of\nRespondent Strother\u2019s tenure as General Counsel, and Respondent knew of this conduct by no\nlater than 2011. Despite his and the Law Department\u2019s knowledge of the problem, Respondent\nStrother took no meaningful action to correct the sales practices misconduct problem. He also\nfailed to advise the Board or the CEO that the Community Bank\u2019s business model incentivized\nwidespread illegal conduct. Instead, until sales goals were eliminated in October 2016, the Law\nDepartment partnered with the Community Bank in preserving the business model that resulted\nin hundreds of thousands of employees committing violations of laws and regulations.\n(300) Additionally, during Respondent Strother\u2019s tenure as General Counsel, the Bank\ndesigned and maintained controls to catch only the most egregious instances of the illegal\nconduct. The Law Department Respondent Strother supervised knew of the Community Bank\u2019s\n62 deficient controls during his tenure as General Counsel. Respondent Strother should have known\nof the deficient controls\nDespite\nhis and the Law Department\u2019s knowledge, Respondent Strother did nothing to ensure that the\nBank maintained controls that were reasonably designed to prevent and detect widespread illegal\nactivity or to advise the Board or the CEO that the controls were severely deficient and needed to\nbe changed.\n(301) Throughout Respondent Strother\u2019s tenure as General Counsel, multiple sources\nsupplied him with information regarding the extent, scope, and root cause of sales practices\nmisconduct and the Bank\u2019s deficient controls. Those sources included: the attorneys who worked\nfor him in the Law Department; various management committees on which he was a member;\nand employees across Community Bank regions who wrote letters and emails to him and other\nmembers of the Operating Committee expressing concern about pressure to meet unreasonable\nsales goals causing illegal activity across the Bank and pleading for change. Regardless of the\namount of information Respondent Strother received about sales practices misconduct, he took\nno meaningful action to address the problem or inform the Board or the CEO about the problem.\n(302) The Bank\u2019s elimination of sales goals in the Community Bank in October 2016\nhad nothing to do with any advice from Respondent Strother or the Law Department. He never\nadvised that the Community Bank\u2019s business model was broken or that it was a significant\ncontributor to massive illegal activity and catastrophic reputational damage for the Bank.\n(303) Not only did Respondent Strother fail to properly escalate the sales practices\nmisconduct problem to the Board or the CEO, he provided the Board with false, misleading, and\nincomplete information about sales practices misconduct even after the May 2015 Los Angeles\n63 City Attorney\u2019s lawsuit. Respondent Strother provided that same information to the OCC.\nRespondent Strother never corrected the false, misleading, and incomplete information provided\nto the Board and the OCC about sales practices misconduct.\nThe Systemic Sales Practices Misconduct Problem Existed for Nearly the Entirety of\nRespondent Strother\u2019s Tenure as General Counsel\n(304) The systemic sales practices misconduct problem existed from the beginning of\nRespondent Strother\u2019s tenure as General Counsel in 2004 and continued until sales goals in the\nCommunity Bank were eliminated in October 2016.\n(305) Respondent Strother understood sales practices misconduct to constitute criminal\nactivity, including fraud, falsification of bank records, and\u2014in certain states in which the Bank\noperated\u2014identity theft. Moreover, he understood sales practices misconduct to violate laws\nprohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\n(306)\n(307) By no later than 2011, Respondent Strother had adequate information to identify\nthe systemic nature of the sales practices misconduct problem, its root cause, and the legal\nimplications for the Bank.\n(308) The Law Department was the repository of critical and comprehensive\ninformation concerning all aspects of sales practices misconduct in the Community Bank,\nincluding the unreasonable sales goals, unreasonable pressure, and intentionally inadequate\ncontrols.\n(309) Throughout Respondent Strother\u2019s tenure as General Counsel, he and the Law\nDepartment he supervised received ongoing information from various sources regarding the\n64 extent, scope, and root cause of sales practices misconduct, as well as the severely deficient\ncontrols.\n(310) Respondent Strother was a member of the Team Member Misconduct Executive\nCommittee, Incentive Compensation Committee, and the Enterprise Risk Management\nCommittee, and was Chair of the Bank\u2019s Ethics Committee.\na. As Chair of the Bank\u2019s Ethics Committee, Respondent Strother knew that\napproximately half of EthicsLine complaints each year related to sales integrity\nviolations. Respondent Strother testified before the OCC that the EthicsLine data\nhe received was indicative of a \u201clarge problem.\u201d\nb. At an October 2012 Ethics Committee meeting, the former Chief Security Officer\nand Head of Corporate Investigations reported that \u201c[c]oncern continues for sales\nintegrity cases as the volume continues to increase in Community Banking. . . .\nThere\u2019s a need to be mindful of this activity; EthicsLine calls are up 16% over last\nyear. 50% of calls are related to sales integrity.\u201d\nc. At an August 2013 Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee meeting,\nRespondent Strother received a presentation that highlighted important\nmisconduct considerations, including whether the controls were \u201callowing to[o]\nmuch opportunity\u201d for employees to commit misconduct and whether the line of\nbusiness \u201ccreat[ed] an environment whereby the [employee] must commit\nmisconduct.\u201d At that meeting, the former Chief Security Officer and Head of\nCorporate Investigations warned: \u201c[t]oo much opportunity or too much personal\nor business pressure can sway most anyone.\u201d\n65 d. In an April 9, 2014 Enterprise Risk Management Committee meeting, Respondent\nStrother learned that one to two percent of Community Bank employees (1,000 to\n2,000) were terminated each year for sales practices-related wrongdoing.\n(311) Employees wrote letters and emails to Respondent Strother and other members of\nthe Operating Committee expressing concern about pressure to meet unreasonable sales goals\ncausing illegal activity across the Community Bank.\n(312) The Board Report described the attorneys who worked in the Law Department,\nparticularly those in the Employment Law Section and the Litigation & Workout Division, as\nhaving \u201csignificant involvement with sales integrity issues.\u201d\n(313) The 2004 Investigation Report that Respondent Strother\u2019s Deputy General\nCounsel received noted that \u201c[w]hen terminated team members challenge Wells Fargo through\nthe legal system\u2019s unemployment hearing process the court\u2019s decisions almost exclusively rule in\nfavor of the former team member. For example, in the state of Washington in the past three years\nWells Fargo has not won a single decision. This is typical nationwide. Several judges have made\ndisparaging comments about the sales incentive plans and one was quoted directly saying\nrhetorically \u2018You[\u2019re] supposed to be a bank, not a used car lot.\u2019\u201d\n(314) Employment lawyers in the Law Department were aware of and advised on\ninvestigations and individual and mass termination decisions related to sales practices\nmisconduct, as well as any subsequent employment litigation arising out of those terminations.\na.\n66 (315) The Board Report found that by 2011, employment lawyers \u201crecognize[d] sales\npressure in the Community Bank environment as a root cause of gaming cases.\u201d\n(316) Over the course of 14 years, attorneys in the Law Department participated in\nvarious cross-functional teams formed specifically to address rampant sales practices\nmisconduct. For example:\na. Law Department attorneys, including the Deputy General Counsel, participated in\na sales integrity task force that existed from 2002 through 2004. The task force\nwas formed to address rapidly rising rates of sales practices misconduct that was\n\u201coccurring in all regions.\u201d The task force recognized that the Community Bank\u2019s\nincentive compensation plans \u201cmay encourage inappropriate sales behaviors\u201d;\nb. A former Chief Security Officer provided the Deputy General Counsel with a\ncopy of the 2004 Investigation Report, which explained that instances of gaming\nwere rapidly increasing and \u201cgeographically consistent corporate-wide,\u201d and that\nemployees engaged in misconduct because they feared \u201closing their jobs for not\nmeeting performance expectations\u201d;\nc. Beginning in May 2011, three attorneys in the Law Department were assigned to\nparticipate in another sales integrity task force. The task force concluded that \u201cthe\nsales culture, sales plan pressure, local performance expectations and messaging\ncreate fear among team member populations\u201d; and\n67 d. Attorneys participated on a cross-functional team called the Core Team, created\nafter the 2013 Los Angeles Times articles to ensure consistency in termination\ndecisions for sales practices misconduct.\n(317) During Respondent Strother\u2019s tenure, attorneys in the Law Department he\nsupervised were aware of and advised on the methodology used by the Community Bank to\ndetect sales practices misconduct, including the severely deficient proactive monitoring\nthresholds designed to identify only the most egregious illegal activity.\nRespondent Strother and the Law Department He Supervised Played a Critical Role in\nEnabling Ongoing Illegal Activity in the Community Bank\n(318) Respondent Strother and the Law Department he supervised were aware of the\nlongstanding sales practices misconduct problem and did nothing meaningful to address it.\nInstead, Respondent Strother and the Law Department were instrumental in maintaining the\nCommunity Bank\u2019s business model that resulted in rampant criminal and legal violations.\nRespondent Strother and the Law Department:\na. failed to adequately oversee employee misconduct and approved the Community\nBank\u2019s incentive compensation plans consisting of unreasonable sales goals;\nb.\nc. protected the Community Bank\u2019s ability to terminate employees for not meeting\nthe unreasonable sales goals; and\nd. obtained an exception to the Bank\u2019s insurance coverage to allow individuals who\nengaged in sales practices misconduct to remain employed.\nRespondent Strother Failed to Provide Adequate Oversight Regarding Employee Misconduct\nand Incentive Compensation Plans Consisting of Unreasonable Sales Goals\n(319) As a member of the Incentive Compensation Committee from approximately\n2010 through 2015, Respondent Strother was directly responsible for the Community Bank\u2019s\n68 deficient incentive compensation system. The Incentive Compensation Committee, including\nRespondent Strother, failed to provide oversight over the Community Bank\u2019s incentive\ncompensation plans, which consisted of unreasonable sales goals and were a significant root\ncause of systemic illegal activity across the Community Bank for years.\n(320) Respondent Strother agreed in testimony before the OCC that the Bank \u201chad an\nincentive compensation system that was poorly designed, poorly monitored and managed and\nallowed to remain in place too long.\u201d Respondent Strother was responsible for overseeing the\nBank\u2019s incentive compensation system.\n(321) It was common knowledge at the Bank that the root cause of sales practices\nmisconduct was the unreasonable sales goals and the extreme pressure on employees to meet\nthose goals.\n(322) Throughout Respondent Strother\u2019s tenure as General Counsel, the Law\nDepartment he supervised reviewed and approved the Community Bank\u2019s incentive\ncompensation plans consisting of unreasonable sales goals.\n(323) In November 2013, the Head of Community Bank Human Resources stated: \u201cwe\nwill need to present all of our IC [incentive compensation] plans to . . . legal for review and\napproval before we can implement them.\u201d\n(324) In July 2011, the Company and Wells Fargo Financial, Inc., a financial subsidiary\nof the Company, entered into a Consent Order with the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve Order\u201d).\n69 a. Respondent Strother signed the Federal Reserve Order as the only representative\nfor the Company.\nb. The Federal Reserve Order stated that Wells Fargo Financial employees engaged\nin the misconduct at issue \u201cin order to meet sales performance standards or\nreceive incentive compensation\u201d and that Wells Fargo Financial\u2019s controls were\ninadequate to prevent and detect the misconduct.\nc. Sixteen branch level employees of Wells Fargo Financial were prohibited from\nemployment in the banking industry in connection with the Federal Reserve\nOrder.\nd. The Bank created the Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee, of which\nRespondent Strother was a member, to ensure the causes of misconduct in Wells\nFargo Financial were not also contributing to problems in other lines of business.\n(325) Respondent Strother agreed in sworn testimony before the OCC that as General\nCounsel he had \u201ca role to play in trying to assure that the problems that [gave] rise to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s consent order [were] not happening in other [lines of business].\u201d He failed in that role.\n(326) As Respondent Strother himself agreed in sworn testimony before the OCC, the\nproblems that gave rise to the Federal Reserve Order were \u201cvery similar\u201d to the sales practices\nmisconduct issues in the Community Bank.\n(327) In fact, the sales practices misconduct problem in the Community Bank was not\nonly similar to, but far exceeded in magnitude the issues that had occurred in Wells Fargo\nFinancial. Respondent Strother repeatedly received EthicsLine reports demonstrating this fact in\nthe months and years following the Federal Reserve Order.\n70 Continued Use of Intentionally Inadequate Controls\n(328)\n(329)\n(330)\nA pause in proactive monitoring hindered detection of additional\nemployees engaged in sales practices misconduct. The Law Department, under Respondent\nStrother\u2019s supervision, never followed through to ensure the Community Bank was in fact\naddressing the root causes of sales practices misconduct and taking appropriate action.\n(331)\n71 (332)\n(333) Respondent Strother testified before the OCC that the fact that the 99.99 and\n99.95% proactive monitoring thresholds only identified 3 to 18 employees per month was\n\u201cstunning.\u201d\n(334)\nRespondent Strother undertook no effort to ensure the Bank\u2019s controls to prevent and\ndetect sales practices misconduct were legally sufficient.\n(335) Respondent Strother and senior members of the Law Department he supervised\nprepared the CEO for his testimony before Congress in September 2016.\n(336) The CEO expected those executives who prepared him for his Congressional\ntestimony \u201cto be fully candid with [him] and give [him] all the information that [he] or Congress\nrequested[.]\u201d\n(337) Respondent Strother and the Law Department failed to appropriately or\nadequately prepare and advise the CEO in connection with his testimony in multiple respects,\nincluding with respect to SSCOT\u2019s proactive monitoring of sales practices misconduct.\n(338) In prepared testimony presented to the United States Senate Committee on\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on September 20, 2016, the CEO testified that SSCOT\n72 engaged \u201cin proactive monitoring of data analytics, specifically for the purpose of rooting out\nsales practice violations.\u201d\na. Respondent Strother attended the CEO\u2019s Congressional testimony.\nb. Respondent Strother, who prepared the CEO for his Congressional testimony,\nknew or should have known that SSCOT\u2019s proactive monitoring was never done\nfor the purpose of \u201crooting out\u201d sales practices misconduct; to the contrary, the\nthresholds SSCOT used were intended and designed to detect only a tiny fraction\nof sales practices misconduct.\nc.\nd.\n(339)\n(340) The CEO testified before the OCC:\nQ And would you have expected the people who were assisting\nyou with preparing this [Congressional] testimony, who knew what\nthe thresholds were and knew what SSCOT was doing, to have\nalerted you about this subject before you presented this testimony?\nA Assuming they knew \u2013\nQ Yes, sir.\nA -- and assuming it would have come to them, I would have\nexpected them to opine on this issue.\nQ Okay. And would you have expected whoever did the scrub\n[review of the Congressional testimony] afterwards, if they knew\nabout the thresholds, to have alerted you about this point?\nA Yes, to that.\n73 (341)\n(342)\nRespondent Strother and the Law Department he Supervised Protected the Community Bank\u2019s\nAbility to Terminate Employees for Not Meeting the Unreasonable Sales Goals\n(343) The Community Bank\u2019s practice of terminating employees for failing to meet\nunreasonable sales goals imposed extreme pressure on employees and resulted in systemic illegal\nactivity.\n(344) Terminating employees for failing to meet unreasonable sales goals was an\nimportant aspect of the Community Bank\u2019s business model. During Respondent Strother\u2019s tenure\nas General Counsel, neither the Law Department nor Respondent Strother ever advised the Bank\nthat it should remove the threat of termination for not meeting unreasonable sales goals.\nan Exception to the Bank\u2019s Insurance Coverage Allowing\nIndividuals Who Engaged in Sales Practices Misconduct to Remain Employed\n(345) Under Respondent Strother\u2019s supervision, the Law Department successfully aided\nthe Community Bank\u2019s efforts to avoid terminating employees for sales practices misconduct. As\na result, employees continued to be terminated for failing to meet the unreasonable sales goals,\nwhile employees who engaged in illegal activity to meet the unreasonable sales goals could\ncontinue their employment at the Bank.\n(346) Beginning no later than 2002, senior leaders in the Community Bank repeatedly\nengaged the Law Department to obtain an exception to the Bank\u2019s fidelity bond in order to limit\nthe number of terminations for sales practices misconduct.\n74 (347) Fidelity bonds are insurance policies that insure banks against losses caused by\ndishonest acts of their employees. Federal law requires national banks to maintain adequate\nfidelity bond coverage over its employees. Under the Bank\u2019s previous fidelity bond policy,\nemployees were not bondable if they engaged in dishonest acts, such as sales practices\nmisconduct, and therefore had to be terminated.\n(348) In 2002, nearly an entire branch in Colorado engaged in a form of gaming\ninvolving issuing debit cards without customer consent and improper teller referrals. As the\nBoard Report explains: \u201c[r]ather than terminate everyone [] involved, which would have\neliminated most of the branch\u2019s tellers and personal bankers, Wells Fargo sought and obtained an\nexception to the fidelity bond from its underwriter. Employment Law Section attorneys advised\nin connection with the incident.\u201d Terminating an entire branch en masse in 2002 would have\nbrought unwanted public attention to and exposed the sales practices misconduct problem, much\nlike the terminations that resulted in the Los Angeles Times articles in 2013. Neither the Law\nDepartment nor the Community Bank wanted this outcome.\n(349) In 2016, the Bank ultimately obtained an exception to the fidelity bond such that\nit was no longer required to terminate employees who engaged in dishonest acts, provided the\nemployee caused loss to the Bank of $5,000 or less.\n(350)\n(351)\n75 a.\n(352) In April 2016, the Law Department succeeded in obtaining this exception to the\nfidelity bond.\n(353) Respondent Strother knew or should have known that rather than changing the\nbusiness model, the Community Bank pursued avenues to avoid terminating employees who\nengaged in sales practices misconduct to meet the sales goals and limit publicity of this fact to\navoid public or regulatory scrutiny\u2014and sought and obtained the Law Department\u2019s assistance\nin doing so.\nRespondent Strother Failed to Escalate to the Board and Properly Advise Them on the\nLegal Risks of Sales Practices Misconduct\n(354) Hundreds of thousands of employees in the Bank\u2019s largest line of business\nengaged in systemic illegal activity for 14 years. The Law Department allowed and enabled this\nsystemic illegal activity to persist.\n(355) The Law Department that Respondent Strother supervised knew about the root\ncause and scope of sales practices misconduct during the entire time the problem existed, which\ncoincided with his tenure as General Counsel. Respondent Strother himself recognized the\n\u201csystemic nature of sales practice[s] misconduct [by] Fall 2013.\u201d Nevertheless, he failed to\n76 escalate the sales practices misconduct problem to the Board and the CEO. Regardless of the\namount of information supplied to him about the sales practices misconduct problem, at no point\nduring his tenure as General Counsel did Respondent Strother advise the Board and the CEO that\nthe Community Bank\u2019s business model motivated employees to break the law, that the business\nmodel needed to be changed, and that the Bank\u2019s controls were inadequate and not reasonably\ndesigned to prevent and detect serious legal violations associated with sales practices\nmisconduct.\n(356) The former Chair of the Risk Committee of the Board testified before the OCC\nabout sales practices misconduct: \u201cI felt the legal department was not doing a very good job\nkeeping the Board advised of matters the Board should be advised about.\u201d\n(357)\n(358) Respondent failed to share information about the duration of sales practices\nmisconduct with the Board.\n(359) Shortly after the Los Angeles City Attorney lawsuit, Respondent Strother\nsubmitted the May 19, 2015 Memo to the Risk Committee of the Board, which contained false,\nmisleading, and incomplete information about critical aspects of sales practices misconduct in\nthe Community Bank, including the scope, extent, duration, and root cause of the problem, and\nthe adequacy of controls used to prevent and detect illegal activity.\n(360) The May 19, 2015 Memo represented that only 230 Bank employees had been\nterminated in connection with the Bank\u2019s review of sales practices misconduct.\n77 (361) Due to his role as General Counsel and his participation on the Enterprise Risk\nManagement Committee, Respondent Strother knew no later than April 2014 that the\nCommunity Bank terminated 1,000-2,000 employees per year for engaging in sales practices-\nrelated wrongdoing.\n(362) Respondent Strother failed to ensure that the May 19, 2015 Memo accurately\nrepresented the scope of sales practices misconduct in the Community Bank.\n(363)\nNevertheless, Respondent Strother submitted the false, misleading, and incomplete final version\nto the Risk Committee. The inclusion of threshold information in the May 19, 2015 Memo would\nhave alerted the Risk Committee to the false, misleading, and incomplete content in the memo.\n(364) Respondent Strother knew or should have known that the May 19, 2015 Memo\ncontained false, misleading, and incomplete information about critical aspects of the sales\npractices misconduct problem.\n(365) On May 18, 2015, Respondent Strother transmitted the false, misleading, and\nincomplete May 19, 2015 Memo to the OCC.\n(366) Respondent Strother acknowledges that attorneys in the Law Department he\nsupervised drafted the May 19, 2015 Memo along with the Community Bank.\n(367) By May 19, 2015, the day after Respondent Strother submitted the memo to the\nOCC, he knew that the information contained in the May 19, 2015 Memo was misleading.\n78 (368)\na.\nb.\nc.\n(369) Respondent Strother testified before the OCC that the root cause of sales practices\nmisconduct as described in the May 19, 2015 Memo (\u201cintentional team member misconduct\nbased on the fact that only a small percentage of Retail Banking team members engaged in the\noutlier behavior\u201d) was not the only root cause. He stated: \u201c[k]nowing what I know today, I could\nunderstand why someone might feel mislead [sic]. . . . I would say one root cause was intentional\n79 team member misconduct. Another root cause was sales goals that were difficult to meet and too\ninflexible and too centrally based. . . . And it\u2019s true, that is true, intentional team member\nmisconduct is one of the causes but -- and it\u2019s a root cause, but there -- I don\u2019t know if you have\nto boil it down to one or not but they did. And I think that it\u2019s not accurate.\u201d\n(370)\n(371)\n(372) In July 2015, Respondent Strother met with senior OCC officials and discussed\nsales practices. When another Operating Committee member represented to the OCC that the\nnumber of Bank employees terminated for sales practices misconduct had grown to 260,\nRespondent Strother failed to inform the OCC that in fact, the Bank had terminated thousands of\nemployees for such misconduct.\n(373)\n(374) Following the May 2015 Risk Committee meeting\n,\n80 Respondent Strother failed to take any reasonable steps to address sales practices misconduct or\nthe deficient controls. Indeed, he failed to inquire about or challenge the restrictive criteria the\nCommunity Bank was using to detect sales practices misconduct, even after this information was\nsupplied to him.\n(375)\n(376) Nevertheless, Respondent Strother never informed the Board about the root cause\nof sales practices misconduct and the problem\u2019s scope, or the Community Bank\u2019s 99.99 and\n99.95% thresholds to detect limited types of sales practices misconduct. Furthermore, the\nrestrictive thresholds remained in place through October 2016.\n* * *\n(377) By reason of Respondent Strother\u2019s misconduct, the OCC seeks a Cease and\nDesist Order against Respondent Strother pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(b) on the grounds that he\nengaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the affairs of the Bank.\n(378) By reason of Respondent Strother\u2019s misconduct, the OCC assesses a civil money\npenalty against Respondent Strother pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(i) on the following grounds:\n81 a. Respondent Strother recklessly engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in\nconducting the affairs of the Bank; and breached his fiduciary duties to the Bank;\nb. Respondent Strother\u2019s unsafe or unsound practices and breaches of his fiduciary\nduties were part of a pattern of misconduct, resulted in pecuniary gain or other\nbenefit to him, and caused more than minimal loss to the Bank.\nARTICLE VIII\nRESPONDENT JULIAN RECKLESSLY ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND\nPRACTICES AND BREACHED HIS FIDUCIARY DUTY\n(379) This Article repeats and realleges all Articles in this Notice.\n(380) Respondent Julian was the Chief Auditor and head of Audit from March 2012 to\nOctober 2018.\n(381) As Chief Auditor, Respondent Julian reported directly to the Chair of the Audit\nand Examination Committee of the Board.\n(382) Respondent Julian also reported administratively to the CEO.\n(383) During his tenure as Chief Auditor, Respondent Julian was a member of the:\nOperating Committee; Enterprise Risk Management Committee; Incentive Compensation\nCommittee; Ethics Committee; and Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee.\n(384) In or around October 2018, the Bank placed Respondent Julian on administrative\nleave.\n(385) In or around October 2019, Respondent Julian retired from the Bank.\n(386) Respondent Julian was an officer of the Bank and an \u201cinstitution-affiliated party\u201d\nof the Bank as that term is defined in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(u), having served in such capacity within\nsix (6) years from the date hereof (see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(i)(3)).\n82 (387) The OCC is the \u201cappropriate Federal banking agency\u201d as that term is defined in\n12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(q) and is authorized to initiate and maintain these cease and desist and civil\nmoney penalty actions against Respondent Julian pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(b) and (i).\nRespondent Julian\u2019s Responsibilities\n(388) Audit\u2019s charter defined its scope of work to be \u201cdetermin[ing] if the [Bank\u2019s] risk\nmanagement, systems of control, and governance processes are adequate and functioning as\nintended.\u201d\n(389) Respondent Julian testified before the OCC: \u201cAudit\u2019s role is to come in and to\nassess the adequacy of those controls to ensure that . . . they\u2019re working as appropriate. And if\nnot, then to provide . . . comment, provide issues, raise concerns to management, raise concerns\nto the Board[.]\u201d\n(390) Audit\u2019s charter further specified that its work was to ensure:\na. \u201cFraud risk management is effectively managed and the company\u2019s customers and\ninternal resources are protected\u201d;\nb. \u201cReputation risk is effectively managed and the company\u2019s brand protected\u201d;\nc. \u201cCompensation programs incent appropriate and desired behavior\u201d;\nd. \u201c[E]mployees\u2019 actions are in compliance with the policies, standards, procedures,\nand applicable laws and regulations.\u201d\n(391) Respondent Julian was responsible for ensuring that Audit adequately executed its\nduties.\n(392) Respondent Julian was responsible for the accuracy and completeness of audits,\nincluding those of the Community Bank.\n83 Respondent Julian Knew About Sales Practices Misconduct for Years\n(393) Between 2012 and 2016, Respondent Julian was well-informed of sales practices\nmisconduct issues, volumes, and trends through his role as Chief Auditor, his membership on\nvarious management committees, and employee complaints.\n(394) As Chief Auditor, Respondent Julian had unrestricted access to all functions,\nrecords, property, and personnel in the Bank, including the Community Bank.\n(395) Respondent Julian knew or should have known about the Community Bank\u2019s\nsales practices misconduct problem by no later than 2012.\n(396) Respondent Julian admitted in his sworn statement before the OCC that beginning\nin 2012 he was informed of the sales practices misconduct problem by various sources, including\nCorporate Investigations, the Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee, the Ethics\nCommittee, and news articles.\n(397) For example, in March 2013 he wrote to Respondent McLinko that the Chief\nSecurity Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations \u201cis presenting some data and Community\nBanking has a lot of issues [related to team member fraud] each year[.]\u201d\n(398) Respondent Julian routinely received information on sales practices through the\nTeam Member Misconduct Executive Committee, the Ethics Committee, and the Enterprise Risk\nManagement Committee.\na. In February 2013, the Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee\u2014\nincluding Respondent Julian\u2014received a presentation that showed that \u201csales\nintegrity violations\u201d was the second-most common category of employee\ninvestigations.\n84 b. In August 2013, the Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee\u2014including\nRespondent Julian\u2014received data that approximately half of the over 7,000\nEthicsLine complaints investigated by Corporate Investigations related to sales\nintegrity violations and that the number of sales integrity cases was increasing.\nc. At the same Team Member Misconduct Executive Committee meeting,\nRespondent Julian received a presentation that highlighted important misconduct\nconsiderations, including whether the controls were \u201callowing to[o] much\nopportunity\u201d for employees to commit misconduct and whether the line of\nbusiness \u201ccreat[ed] an environment whereby the [employee] must commit\nmisconduct.\u201d At that meeting, the former Chief Security Officer and Head of\nCorporate Investigations warned: \u201c[t]oo much opportunity or too much personal\nor business pressure can sway most anyone.\u201d\nd. The Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations reported to the\nEthics Committee, including Respondent Julian, in August 2013 that \u201cSales\nIntegrity issues are most prevalent \u2013 there needs to be continued focus in this\narea\u201d and that most EthicsLine reports are \u201cassociated with Sales Integrity\nIssues.\u201d\ne. In an April 9, 2014 Enterprise Risk Management Committee meeting, Community\nBank leadership informed the committee, including Respondent Julian, that one to\ntwo percent of Community Bank employees (1,000 to 2,000) were terminated\neach year for sales practices-related wrongdoing.\nf. Respondent Julian took no meaningful action after receiving any of this\ninformation.\n85 (399) Respondent Julian also received information related to sales practices from\nCorporate Investigations, which had reported to Audit until 2012. By no later than 2002,\nCorporate Investigations knew about the sales practices misconduct problem and its root cause.\n(400) Respondent Julian explained in an email to the OCC: \u201caudit methodology\nincludes contacting Corporate Investigations at the beginning of each audit to determine if there\nare any cases\/trends related to the area under review.\u201d\n(401) In February 2011, Corporate Investigations met with Audit and informed auditors\nabout case volumes and trends related to sales practices, including the number of terminations\nand that \u201ccustomer consent\u201d was the number one issue.\n(402) In July 2012, the Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations\ninformed Respondent Julian: \u201c[O]ur data continues to highlight a concerning trend in the area of\nSales Integrity \u2013 from the increase in EthicsLine reports, to the increase in executive complaint\nletters \/ OCC referral, and increases in confirmed fraud, thus, we need to continue to escalate this\nissue with senior leadership. . . . Our data continues to point to a very negative trend.\u201d The Chief\nSecurity Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations also informed Respondent Julian in the\nemail that Respondent Russ Anderson, the Community Bank\u2019s Group Risk Officer, was\n\u201cminimizing\u201d the seriousness of the problem to executive management.\na. Respondent Julian took no meaningful actions in response to this email.\nb. Respondent Julian never addressed the Chief Security Officer\u2019s warnings in his\nJuly 2012 email that there was a \u201cvery negative trend\u201d related to sales practices or\nthat Respondent Russ Anderson was minimizing negative information being\nsubmitted to executive management.\n86 c. Respondent Julian admitted in his sworn testimony before the OCC that a\ncompetent auditor receiving this email should have investigated the matter further\nand determined if the claims were true.\n(403) Beginning in 2012, Corporate Investigations also periodically emailed\nRespondent Julian to notify him of EthicsLine complaints alleging sales practices misconduct.\n(404) Respondent Julian also was aware of the Los Angeles Times articles at the end of\n2013 alleging sales practices misconduct within the Community Bank. The Chief Security\nOfficer and Head of Corporate Investigations emailed the first article to Respondent Julian and\nexplained it was a \u201cbig deal[.]\u201d\na. Respondent Julian took no meaningful action in response to the Los Angeles\nTimes articles.\n(405) Respondent Julian testified before the OCC that, after reading the articles, he\nstarted \u201cthinking that, gosh, is there a problem?\u201d\nRespondent Julian Failed to Identify and Escalate the Sales Practices Misconduct Problem\n(406) Respondent Julian failed to fulfill his responsibilities under Audit\u2019s charter and\nfailed to abide by his own description of Audit\u2019s function as the third line of defense.\n(407) Respondent Julian failed to ensure that: fraud risk management and reputation\nrisk were effectively managed; compensation programs incented appropriate and desired\nbehavior; and employees\u2019 actions complied with policies, standards, procedures, and applicable\nlaws and regulations.\n(408) Respondent Julian and Audit failed to ask basic questions about the Bank\u2019s\ncontrols to prevent and detect sales practices misconduct, which would have exposed the\nmagnitude of the problem and the severely deficient controls.\n87 (409) Respondent Julian failed to ensure that Audit conducted a meaningful review of\nsales practices in the Community Bank.\n(410) Respondent Julian admitted in sworn testimony before the OCC that the\nCommunity Bank had a significant, systemic problem with sales practices misconduct.\n(411) Under Respondent Julian\u2019s leadership, Audit never criticized the Community\nBank for its systemic sales practices misconduct problem or identified its root cause in any audit\nreport, despite all the information he received that the Community Bank had a widespread\nproblem. In so doing, Respondent Julian is responsible for perpetuating the Community Bank\u2019s\nsystemic sales practices misconduct problem.\n(412) Respondent Julian failed to identify and escalate the sales practices misconduct\nproblem to the Audit and Examination Committee, the full Board, or any of the committees on\nwhich he served. Respondent Julian\u2019s reports to the Audit and Examination Committee never\nidentified the systemic sales practices misconduct problem at the Community Bank.\n(413) Despite all the information he received indicating a serious and pervasive sales\npractices misconduct problem, in each of the audits conducted between 2012 and 2016 that\ninvolved aspects of sales practices misconduct, Audit, under Respondent Julian\u2019s leadership,\nawarded high ratings to the Community Bank.\n(414) Respondent Julian acknowledged in his sworn statement before the OCC that he\nwould now consider the Community Bank\u2019s controls over sales practices misconduct from 2012\nto 2016 to be \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d the lowest possible rating that Audit could issue at that time.\n(415) In October 2012, Audit issued a report finding that internal controls for incentive\ncompensation within the regional bank (consisting of the retail branch network) were \u201ceffective,\u201d\nthe highest possible rating .\n88 (416) In December 2013, the Community Bank received an \u201ceffective\u201d rating\u2014the\nhighest possible rating\u2014for its sales quality \/ sales integrity internal controls.\n(417) In June 2015, the OCC issued five Matters Requiring Attention related to sales\npractices. One Matter Requiring Attention required Audit to \u201creassess their coverage of sales\npractices and provide an enterprise view.\u201d\n(418) In response to the Matter Requiring Attention, Audit indicated that it was\ncommitted to maintaining independence and developing a comprehensive audit approach with\nrespect to sales practices.\n(419) Audit committed that it would be \u201cengaged with the various LOBs (lines of\nbusiness) as they develop and implement corrective actions to the Enterprise Sales Practices\nMRA\u2019s. \u2026 Issue monitoring and validation, reviewing governance processes and enhanced\npolicy, monitoring of projects\/initiatives to enhance Enterprise Sales Practices compliance, and\nobtaining an understanding of key activities and functions performed to ensure compliance with\nenterprise sales practices along with their sustainability.\u201d\n(420) Notwithstanding all of the commitments which Audit made, Audit continued to\naward high ratings to the Community Bank related to sales practices during a time when sales\npractices misconduct continued to be rampant.\n(421) Even in March 2016, after the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s lawsuit and the five\nMatters Requiring Attention from the OCC, Audit rated the Community Bank\u2019s system of\ninternal controls related to customer account opening as \u201ceffective.\u201d\n(422) Throughout his tenure as Chief Auditor, Respondent Julian failed to effectively\naudit the Community Bank related to sales practices misconduct.\n89 (423) At no point prior to October 2016 did Respondent Julian identify through Audit\u2019s\nwork the systemic nature of the sales practices misconduct problem or the inadequate controls\nfor preventing and detecting the misconduct.\n(424) These failures allowed the problem to persist for years and prevented the Board\nfrom being accurately informed on the topic.\n(425) Corporate Human Resources and Corporate Risk explicitly relied on Audit\u2019s work\nand findings in preparing annual incentive compensation risk memoranda. These memoranda\nwere submitted to the CEO and the Human Resources Committee of the Board, and later\nprovided to the OCC.\n(426) The memoranda were supposed to incorporate risk outcomes into incentive\ncompensation recommendations for senior management.\n(427) From 2014 through 2016, these memoranda rated Community Bank\u2019s risk\nmanagement in connection with sales practices as \u201csatisfactory,\u201d the highest possible assessment,\nand recommended no impacts to Respondent Tolstedt\u2019s compensation.\n(428) Respondent Julian\u2019s and Audit\u2019s failure to effectively audit the Community Bank\nand identify the systemic nature of sales practices misconduct resulted in incentive compensation\nrisk memoranda that falsely portrayed the Community Bank to be adequately handling the\nproblem.\n(429) This false information was submitted to the CEO and the Human Resources\nCommittee of the Board, and was also provided to the OCC.\n(430) Likewise, Respondent Julian told the Risk Committee of the Board during its May\n2015 meeting that Audit had reviewed sales practices in the Community Bank and had not found\na systemic problem.\n90 (431) Respondent Julian admitted in his sworn statement before the OCC that he and\nAudit should have done more related to sales practices.\na. Respondent Julian testified: \u201c. . . I would agree that audit didn\u2019t do as good a job\ncertainly as it should have done within the context of sales practices. I believe we\ncould have done better and should have done better . . . .\u201d\n(432) Respondent Julian testified that, subsequent to the elimination of sales goals,\nAudit performed work that determined that the Community Bank had a significant and systemic\nproblem with sales practices misconduct and that the root cause was unreasonable sales goals\nand unreasonable pressure to meet those goals. Yet, he never identified these problems when it\nmattered.\n(433) Respondent Julian admitted that his team could have requested information on the\nlevels of sales goals, how often employees were monitored against their goals, the numbers of\nemployees terminated for sales practices misconduct, and the number of employees terminated\nfor failing to meet sales goals.\na. Respondent Julian testified: \u201cGiven that, I should have ensured that my team and,\ntherefore, that I was more informed, that my team would have looked further into\nthe matters, the issues, or followed up in some capacity.\u201d\n(434) In sworn testimony before the OCC, Respondent Julian was unable to posit any\nreasonable explanation for why Audit, under his leadership, did not do more than it did with\nrespect to the sales practices misconduct problem in the Community Bank.\n(435) Respondent Julian himself asked his staff in a September 2016 email about sales\npractices misconduct: \u201cWhere was audit while this activity was taking place? To be honest, I\u2019m\nnot sure how to answer this but am sure the A[udit and] E[xamination] Committee will and\n91 should be asking.\u201d Respondent Julian testified that he never received a \u201cgood answer about\nwhere was audit.\u201d\n* * *\n(436) By reason of Respondent Julian\u2019s misconduct, the OCC seeks a Cease and Desist\nOrder against Respondent Julian pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(b) on the grounds that\nRespondent Julian engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the affairs of the Bank.\n(437) By reason of Respondent Julian\u2019s misconduct, the OCC assesses a civil money\npenalty against Respondent Julian pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(i) on the following grounds:\na. Respondent Julian recklessly engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in\nconducting the affairs of the Bank; and breached his fiduciary duties to the Bank;\nb. Respondent Julian\u2019s practices and breaches of his fiduciary duties were part of a\npattern of misconduct, resulted in pecuniary gain or other benefit to him, and\ncaused more than minimal loss to the Bank.\nARTICLE IX\nRESPONDENT McLINKO RECKLESSLY ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND\nPRACTICES AND BREACHED HIS FIDUCIARY DUTY\n(438) This Article repeats and realleges all Articles in the Notice.\n(439) From approximately 2011 to 2017, Respondent McLinko was an Executive Audit\nDirector at the Bank, responsible for auditing the Community Bank.\n(440) From March 2012 to 2018, Respondent McLinko reported to Respondent Julian.\n(441) Respondent McLinko retired from the Bank on or around April 2019.\n(442) Respondent McLinko was an \u201cinstitution-affiliated party\u201d of the Bank as that term\nis defined in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(u), having served in such capacity within six (6) years from the\ndate hereof (see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(i)(3)).\n92 (443) The OCC is the \u201cappropriate Federal banking agency\u201d as that term is defined in\n12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813(q) and is authorized to initiate and maintain these cease and desist and civil\nmoney penalty actions against Respondent McLinko pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(b) and (i).\nRespondent McLinko Had Responsibility for Community Bank Audits\n(444) Beginning in 2011, Respondent McLinko was responsible for overseeing all\nCommunity Bank audits, which included setting the audit strategy, reviewing and approving\ndraft audit reports, complying with Audit\u2019s charter, and providing credible challenge to\nCommunity Bank management.\n(445) Respondent McLinko was responsible for ensuring that the Community Bank\u2019s\naudit team adequately executed their duties consistent with Audit\u2019s responsibilities.\n(446) Respondent McLinko was responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the\nCommunity Bank\u2019s audits.\nRespondent McLinko Knew of the Sales Practices Misconduct Problem for Years\n(447) Respondent McLinko had access to all functions, records, property, and personnel\nin the Bank, including sales goals, incentive compensation plans, termination data, customer\ncomplaints, and EthicsLine reporting.\n(448) From no later than 2011, Respondent McLinko knew or should have known about\nthe systemic sales practices misconduct problem in the Community Bank and its root cause.\n(449) Respondent McLinko was a member of the Community Bank\u2019s Internal Fraud\nCommittee. As part of that committee, he received reporting from Corporate Investigations that\nthere were thousands of sales integrity cases each year, including thousands of investigations\nrelated to lack of customer consent for products and services.\n93 (450) By no later than 2002, Corporate Investigations knew about the sales practices\nmisconduct problem and its root cause.\n(451) Respondent McLinko explained in an email he drafted for Respondent Julian:\n\u201caudit methodology includes contacting Corporate Investigations at the beginning of each audit\nto determine if there are any cases\/trends related to the area under review.\u201d\n(452) In January 2011, the Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations\ninformed Respondent McLinko: \u201cCommunity Bank sales integrity issue has resulted in two\narrests. This is highly unusual but reinforces the fact that this type of activity is unlawful and\ncertainly poses a significant reputation risk to our company.\u201d\na. Respondent McLinko took no meaningful action in response to this email.\n(453) In February 2011, Corporate Investigations met with Audit and informed auditors\non case volumes and trends related to sales practices, including the number of terminations and\ncases and that \u201ccustomer consent\u201d was the number one issue. Corporate Investigations also\ninformed Audit that some of the Community Bank\u2019s controls with respect to sales practices\namounted to \u201cthe fox guarding the hen house.\u201d\n(454) In July 2011, the Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations\nagain informed Respondent McLinko that \u201cSales Integrity cases continue to surge.\u201d\na. Respondent McLinko took no meaningful action in response to this email.\n(455) In July 2012, the Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations\nagain informed Respondent McLinko that the Bank\u2019s data \u201ccontinues to highlight a concerning\ntrend in the area of [s]ales [i]ntegrity \u2013 from the increase in EthicsLine reports, to the increase in\nexecutive complaint letters\/OCC referrals, and increases in confirmed fraud\u201d and that\nRespondent Russ Anderson \u201cminimiz[ed] the negative information being submitted to executive\n94 management.\u201d The Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations concluded: \u201cwe\nneed to continue to escalate this issue with senior leadership\u201d and stated the data \u201ccontinues to\npoint to a very negative trend.\u201d\na. Respondent McLinko took no meaningful action in response to this email.\n(456) In January 2013, an auditor who reported to Respondent McLinko told him that\nsales integrity \u201cis still [the Chief Security Officer\u2019s] #1 concern.\u201d In that same email, the auditor\nwrote: \u201cI questioned [the Chief Security Officer] as to whether they had discussed root cause for\nsome of the items listed above and was it related to sales pressure. He said he felt a lot of it was\nrelated to the sales goals and pressure. He feels there\u2019s an issue that [Regional Bank] is trying to\nwork through but not a lot of people want to address it with [Respondent Tolstedt].\u201d\na. Respondent McLinko took no meaningful action in response to this email.\n(457) Respondent McLinko also was aware of the Los Angeles Times articles at the end\nof 2013. The Chief Security Officer and Head of Corporate Investigations emailed him the first\narticle and explained it was a \u201cbig deal[.]\u201d\na. Respondent McLinko took no meaningful action in response to the Los Angeles\nTimes articles.\nRespondent McLinko Failed to Identify and Escalate the Sales Practices Misconduct\nProblem in Audit Reports\n(458) Respondent McLinko failed to fulfill his audit responsibilities with respect to the\nsales practices misconduct problem.\n(459) Respondent McLinko admitted in sworn testimony before the OCC that the\nCommunity Bank had a systemic problem with sales practices misconduct.\n95 (460) Respondent McLinko further admitted in his sworn testimony before the OCC\nthat this systemic sales practices misconduct problem persisted until sales goals were eliminated\nin October 2016.\n(461) Respondent McLinko admitted that although the systemic sales practices\nmisconduct problem existed throughout his tenure as Executive Audit Director with\nresponsibility for auditing the Community Bank, none of the Community Bank\u2019s audits\nidentified this problem. In fact, when asked whether Audit ever rated anything in Community\nBank as unsatisfactory, Respondent McLinko replied: \u201cNothing I can think of.\u201d\n(462) Under Respondent McLinko\u2019s leadership, the Community Bank audit team never\ncriticized the Community Bank for its systemic sales practices misconduct problem or identified\nits root cause in any audit report. In so doing, Respondent McLinko allowed the Community\nBank\u2019s systemic sales practices misconduct problem to persist.\n(463) In each of the audits conducted between 2012 and 2016 that involved aspects of\nsales practices misconduct, the Community Bank audit team under Respondent McLinko\u2019s\nleadership awarded high ratings to the Community Bank.\n(464) In October 2012, Audit issued a report finding internal controls for incentive\ncompensation within the regional bank to be \u201ceffective.\u201d\n(465) In December 2013, the Community Bank received an \u201ceffective\u201d rating\u2014the\nhighest possible rating\u2014for its sales quality \/ sales integrity internal controls.\n(466) In June 2015, the OCC issued five Matters Requiring Attention related to sales\npractices. One Matter Requiring Attention required Audit to \u201creassess their coverage of sales\npractices and provide an enterprise view.\u201d\n96 (467) In response to the Matter Requiring Attention, Audit indicated that it was\ncommitted to maintaining independence and developing a comprehensive audit approach with\nrespect to sales practices. The response to the Matter Requiring Attention designated Respondent\nMcLinko as the \u201caccountable executive.\u201d\n(468) The commitments for which Respondent McLinko was the \u201caccountable\nexecutive\u201d included being \u201cengaged with the various LOBs (lines of business) as they develop\nand implement corrective actions to the Enterprise Sales Practices MRA\u2019s. \u2026 Issue monitoring\nand validation, reviewing governance processes and enhanced policy, monitoring of\nprojects\/initiatives to enhance Enterprise Sales Practices compliance, and obtaining an\nunderstanding of key activities and functions performed to ensure compliance with enterprise\nsales practices along with their sustainability.\u201d\n(469) Notwithstanding all of the commitments which Audit made and for which\nRespondent McLinko was the \u201caccountable executive,\u201d the Community Bank audit team under\nRespondent McLinko\u2019s leadership continued to award high ratings to the Community Bank.\na. In March 2016, following the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s lawsuit and the five\nMatters Requiring Attention from the OCC, Audit rated the Community Bank\u2019s\nsystem of internal controls related to customer account opening as \u201ceffective.\u201d\n(470) Far from identifying and escalating the sales practices misconduct problem in the\nCommunity Bank in audit reports, Respondent McLinko personally praised Respondent Tolstedt\nfor her and the Community Bank\u2019s quality of risk management.\na. In March 2016, Respondent McLinko told Respondent Tolstedt that \u201c[w]hile\nmany groups talk about risk management, [Respondent Tolstedt] and [her] team\nlive it.\u201d\n97 b. In July 2016, Respondent McLinko told Respondent Tolstedt: \u201c[i]t\u2019s rare to find a\nbusiness leader who takes risk management as seriously as you do.\u201d\n(471) In April 2016, Respondent McLinko told Respondent Russ Anderson: \u201cI\u2019d\nappreciate it if you don\u2019t mention audit and the risk culture topic together when and if you\napproach the subject with the regulators.\u201d\n(472) In a September 2016 email about sales practices misconduct, Respondent Julian\nasked his staff, including Respondent McLinko: \u201cWhere was audit while this activity was taking\nplace? To be honest, I\u2019m not sure how to answer this but am sure the A[udit and] E[xamination]\nCommittee will and should be asking.\u201d Neither Respondent McLinko, nor anyone else in Audit,\nwas able to provide Respondent Julian with an adequate answer to the question: \u201cWhere was\naudit while this activity was taking place?\u201d\n* * *\n(473) By reason of Respondent McLinko\u2019s misconduct, the OCC seeks a Cease and\nDesist Order against Respondent McLinko pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(b) on the grounds that\nRespondent McLinko engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the affairs of the\nBank.\n(474) By reason of Respondent McLinko\u2019s misconduct, the OCC assesses a civil money\npenalty against Respondent McLinko pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(i) on the following grounds:\na.

Background and Transaction\nCONA is a national bank with its headquarters in McLean, Virginia. CONA reported\n$487.2 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2024. CONA is a wholly owned subsidiary of\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COFC), a Delaware corporation and a financial holding\ncompany with its headquarters also in McLean, Virginia. CONA has branch offices across the\nUnited States, in Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey,\nNew York, Texas, and Virginia, as well as a branch in Canada.\nDiscover Bank is a Delaware state-chartered non-member bank with its headquarters in\nGreenwood, Delaware. Discover Bank reported $147.8 billion in total assets as of\nDecember 31, 2024. Discover Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Financial Services\n(DFS), a Delaware corporation and a financial holding company with its headquarters in\nRiverwoods, Illinois. Discover Bank has no branch offices.\nSubject to approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), COFC will\nacquire DFS. First, COFC will establish Vega Merger Sub, Inc., McLean, Virginia. Second,\nVega Merger Sub., Inc. will merge with and into DFS, with DFS as the surviving corporation and a subsidiary of COFC. Third, and as part of a single, integrated transaction, DFS will merge\nwith and into COFC, with COFC as the surviving corporation. Immediately following the\nholding company mergers, Discover Bank will merge with and into CONA, with CONA as the\nresulting institution (the Bank Merger).\nCONA applied to the OCC on March 21, 2024, for approval of the Bank Merger as an affiliated\ncorporate reorganization pursuant to section 4 of the National Bank Consolidation and\nMerger Act, 12 USC 215a-1, and section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\n12 USC 1828(c) (the Bank Merger Act). In addition, CONA requested approval to retain certain\nDiscover Bank subsidiaries and investments. CONA has submitted supplemental material with\nresponses to various requests for additional information (collectively these materials constitute\nthe Application). COFC submitted relevant applications to the FRB for the holding company-\nrelated transactions.\nThe OCC received 1,370 public comments on the Application. The OCC and the FRB conducted\na Public Meeting with 147 members of the public testifying regarding the Bank Merger\nApplication and COFC\u2019s applications to the FRB on July 19, 2024 (Public Meeting).\nII. Legal Authority\nThe Bank Merger is legally authorized as an interstate merger transaction pursuant to\n12 USC 215a-1 and section 44 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 USC 1831u(a), as added\nby the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the\nRiegle-Neal Act) and as required by 12 USC 215a-1(a), and the regulations of the OCC at\n12 CFR 5.33. The Resulting Bank is authorized to retain and operate offices of both banks\npursuant to section 5155(d) of the Revised Statutes, 12 USC 36(d), and 12 USC 1831u(d)(1).\nThe OCC reviewed CONA\u2019s record of performance under the Community Reinvestment\nAct of 1977 (the CRA), as required by section 402(a)(2) of the CRA, 12 USC 2903(a)(2), and the\nregulations of the OCC at 12 CFR Part 25. The OCC considered all relevant legal and regulatory\nfactors and found them consistent with approval.\nThe Bank Merger satisfies the procedural requirements of 12 USC 215a for the merger of a bank\ninto a national bank. The Bank Merger is authorized as an interstate merger transaction involving\na national bank and an out-of-state bank pursuant to 12 USC 215a-1(a) and 12 USC 1831u(a)(1).\nSuch interstate merger transactions are subject to: (i) compliance with state-imposed age limits,\nif any, subject to the Riegle-Neal Act\u2019s limits; (ii) compliance with certain state filing\nrequirements, to the extent the filing requirements are permitted by the Riegle-Neal Act;\n(iii) compliance with nationwide and state concentration limits; (iv) expanded community\nreinvestment compliance; and (v) adequacy of capital and management skills requirements. The\nOCC has considered these requirements and determined that the Bank Merger satisfies all\napplicable requirements in the Riegle-Neal Act.\nThe OCC has concluded that the Bank Merger is consistent with the Bank Merger Act pursuant\nto 12 USC 1828(c)(2)(A). The Bank Merger Act provides the following: (i) the OCC generally\nmay not approve a merger that would substantially lessen competition; (ii) the OCC must\nconsider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed\n2 institutions; (iii) the OCC must consider the convenience and needs of the community to be\nserved; (iv) the OCC must consider the proposed merger\u2019s risk to the stability of the United\nStates banking or financial system; and (v) the OCC must consider the effectiveness of any\ninsured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combating money\nlaundering activities.\nThe OCC has concluded that the Bank Merger is consistent with all of the Bank Merger Act\nfactors.\n\u2022 First, CONA and Discover Bank will be affiliated at the time of the Bank Merger.\nMergers between banks and their affiliates are generally considered competitively neutral\nand, therefore, normally do not result in adverse competitive effects.\n\u2022 Second, the OCC considered the financial and managerial resources of CONA,\nDiscover Bank, and the Resulting Bank and their future prospects, and the OCC found\nthem consistent with approval.\n\u2022 Third, the OCC considered the convenience and needs of the community to be served by\nthe Resulting Bank and found this factor consistent with approval.\n\u2022 Fourth, the OCC considered CONA\u2019s and Discover Bank\u2019s records of combatting money\nlaundering and found them consistent with approval.\n\u2022 Fifth, the OCC considered the Bank Merger\u2019s risk to the stability of the United States\nbanking or financial system and found it to be consistent with approval.\nUnder section 622 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\n12 USC 1852, as implemented by Regulation XX, 12 CFR 251, an insured national bank\ngenerally may not merge with or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another company,\nif the total consolidated liabilities of the acquiring institution upon consummation of the\ntransaction would exceed 10 percent of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial\ncompanies at the end of the preceding calendar year. The OCC has reviewed the Bank Merger in\nlight of these provisions and determined that the Bank Merger is permissible.\nThe OCC also reviewed CONA\u2019s record of performance under the CRA as required by\n12 USC 2903(a)(2) and 12 CFR Part 25. In CONA\u2019s most recent large bank CRA performance\nevaluation from the OCC, dated August 28, 2023, the OCC assigned CONA an overall CRA\nrating of Outstanding and found CONA\u2019s performance under each of the lending, investment,\nand service tests to be Outstanding. CONA\u2019s record of compliance with the CRA is consistent\nwith approval of the Application.\nA. Ancillary Requests\nThe Application also contains CONA\u2019s notices and requests related to the retention of branches,\noperating subsidiaries, securitization trusts, and public welfare funds and investments to be\nacquired as part of the Bank Merger.\n3 In the Application, CONA requests OCC approval to retain Discover Bank\u2019s main office as a\nbranch of the Resulting Bank. Such retention is authorized, upon application to, and with the\nprior approval of, the OCC pursuant to 12 USC 36(d), 12 USC 1831u(d)(1), 12 CFR 5.30(c)(2),\nand 12 CFR 5.33(e)(2). The OCC approves this request.\nCONA requests, pursuant to 12 CFR 5.33(e)(3) and 12 CFR 5.34, OCC approval to acquire five\nDiscover Bank operating subsidiaries as part of the Bank Merger: Discover Funding LLC;\nGTC Insurance Agency, Inc.; Discover Products, Inc.; Discover Properties LLC; and the\nStudent Loan Corporation. In the Application, CONA indicates that none of Discover Bank\u2019s\noperating subsidiaries are nonconforming and that none of Discover Bank\u2019s operating\nsubsidiaries are engaged in activities impermissible for a national bank. Based on the information\nin the Application, each of the Discover Bank operating subsidiaries is a qualifying subsidiary\nfor purposes of 12 CFR 5.34. The OCC approves this request.\nCONA requests OCC approval to acquire Discover Bank\u2019s four securitization trusts pursuant to\n12 USC 24(Seventh) and 12 CFR 1.3(g): the Discover Card Execution Note Trust; the\nDiscover Card Master Trust; the SLC Private Student Loan Trust 2006-A; and the\nSLC Private Student Loan Trust 2010-A. CONA notes that each trust is a wholly owned direct\nsubsidiary of Discover Bank and will become a wholly owned direct subsidiary of CONA as part\nof the Bank Merger. The OCC approves this request.\nCONA requests OCC approval to acquire and retain Discover Bank\u2019s outstanding public welfare\nfunds and investments. These funds and investments cover various low-income housing tax\ncredit, new market tax credit, venture, equity equivalent investment, community development\nloans, CRA mortgage-backed securities, and tax-exempt housing revenue bond activities of\nDiscover Bank. CONA represents that these funds and investments are permissible for a national\nbank pursuant to either 12 USC 24(Seventh), 12 USC 24(Eleventh), and\/or 12 CFR Part 24. The\nOCC approves this request with respect to any of these funds or investments permissible\npursuant to 12 USC 24(Seventh). For any of these funds or investments permissible pursuant to\n12 USC 24(Eleventh) and 12 CFR Part 24, CONA must submit required filings with the OCC as\ndetailed at 12 CFR Part 24.\nIII. Public Comments\nPublic comments broadly focused on: the effect of the Bank Merger on competition, the financial\nand managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, the\nconvenience and needs of the community to be served, and the risk to the stability of the United\nStates banking or financial system.\nPublic comments generally focused on the following:\n\u2022 The extent to which the Bank Merger will meaningfully increase concentration in\nconsumer credit markets, especially in the markets for credit cards and subprime credit\ncards, as well as structural and business-specific factors that may exacerbate or mitigate\nthis concentration and result in increased prices for consumers through the\n4 Resulting Bank\u2019s market power, with a particular focus on low- and moderate-income\n(LMI) and subprime credit card consumers;\n\u2022 The extent to which the Bank Merger would increase concentration in payments markets\nand structural and business-specific factors that may exacerbate or mitigate this\nconcentration and result in increased prices for consumers and merchants;\n\u2022 Concerns regarding CONA\u2019s business model, especially with regards to LMI and\nsubprime credit consumers, including CONA\u2019s pricing of credit products, debt collection\npractices, credit limit practices, handling of consumer complaints, customer service\nrecord, and rewards programs;\n\u2022 Concerns regarding CONA\u2019s and Discover Bank\u2019s past statutory and regulatory\ncompliance issues, including with respect to anti-money laundering (AML), consumer\nprotection, and discrimination laws and regulations; data security breaches; and CONA\u2019s\nability to integrate Discover Bank within its risk management framework;\n\u2022 Whether the Bank Merger would materially increase risk to the Resulting Bank\u2019s\nfinancial condition or to the stability of the United States banking or financial system,\nincluding in regard to the size of the Resulting Bank and its asset and borrower\ncomposition and concentrations;\n\u2022 What effect the Bank Merger may have on the Resulting Bank\u2019s overall branch network\nand whether efficiency gains related to the Bank Merger may lead to layoffs in specific\ncommunities; and,\n\u2022 CONA\u2019s community engagement and record of supporting community partners and the\nimpact of the Bank Merger on Discover Bank\u2019s community development lending.\nFor additional information on the review of public comments please see the Appendix, below.\nThe OCC considered the public comments and testimony as part of the record and under all\nrelevant statutory factors.\nIV. Condition\nThis approval is subject to the following condition.\n\u2022 Within 120 days of consummation of the Bank Merger, CONA shall provide a plan for\nsupervisory non-objection, which details effective and sustainable corrective action and\ntimelines to address the underlying root causes of any outstanding enforcement actions\nagainst Discover Bank and plans for remediation of harm.\nThis condition of approval is a condition \u201cimposed in writing by a Federal banking agency in\nconnection with any action on any application, notice, or other request\u201d within the meaning of\nSection 18 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 USC 1818.

Lybarger\nDeputy Comptroller\nEnclosure: Survey Letter\n7 Appendix: Discussion of Public Comments\nThe OCC received 1,370 written comments on the Bank Merger, as well as testimony from\n147 members of the public at the Public Meeting. Of the comments, over 1,200 were form letters\nused by commenters largely (but not entirely) to voice opposition to the Bank Merger. Our\nreview considered the full range of comments received, including the concerns raised in form\nletters. The OCC also considered comments received by the FRB on the applications before the\nFRB. This appendix uses the term \u201ccomments\u201d and \u201ccommenters\u201d to refer to all reviewed\nfeedback from written commenters and those who testified at the Public Meeting. Concerns\nraised by commenters touched on a variety of the statutory factors the OCC is required to\nconsider in acting upon a merger application. See 12 USC 1828(c)(5). The OCC carefully\nconsidered the concerns summarized in this Appendix in acting on the Application.\nThe OCC received a mix of comments supporting or opposing the Bank Merger. Additionally,\nsome comments neither explicitly supported nor opposed the Bank Merger but asked the OCC to\nconsider certain topics or condition the Bank Merger on certain terms. Comments broadly\nfocused on the following statutory factors: the effect of the Bank Merger on competition, the\nfinancial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions,\nthe convenience and needs of the community to be served, and the risk to the stability of the\nUnited States banking or financial system.\nMany of the specific concerns simultaneously touch on several of these statutory factors.\nAs such, the following summary of the comments received is grouped topically, rather than\nstrictly according to the statutory factors. These topics broadly include:\n\u2022 The extent to which the Bank Merger will (1) meaningfully increase concentration in\nconsumer credit markets, especially in the markets for credit cards and subprime credit\ncards, as well as structural and business-specific factors that may exacerbate or mitigate\nthis concentration, and (2) result in increased prices for consumers, through the\nResulting Bank\u2019s market power, with a particular focus on LMI and subprime credit card\nconsumers;\n\u2022 The extent to which the Bank Merger will (1) meaningfully increase concentration in\npayments markets, as well as structural and business-specific factors that may exacerbate\nor mitigate this concentration, and (2) result in increased prices for consumers (including\nDiscover Bank\u2019s current customers) and merchants, through the Resulting Bank\u2019s and\nnetwork\u2019s resulting market power, with a particular focus on the role of transaction fees\nand the interplay of regulations on debit card transaction fees related to three- and four-\nparty systems;\n\u2022 Concerns regarding CONA\u2019s business model, especially with regard to LMI and\nsubprime credit consumers, including CONA\u2019s pricing of credit products, debt collection\npractices, credit limit practices, handling of consumer complaints, customer service\nrecord, and rewards programs;\n\u2022 Concerns regarding CONA\u2019s and Discover Bank\u2019s past statutory and regulatory\ncompliance issues, including with respect to AML, consumer protection, and discrimination laws and regulations; data security breaches; and CONA\u2019s ability to\nintegrate Discover Bank within its risk management framework;\n\u2022 Whether the Bank Merger would materially increase risk to the Resulting Bank\u2019s\nfinancial condition or to the stability of the United States banking or financial system,\nincluding in regard to the size of the Resulting Bank and its asset and borrower\ncomposition and concentrations;\n\u2022 What effect the Bank Merger may have on the Resulting Bank\u2019s overall branch network\nand whether efficiency gains related to the Bank Merger may lead to layoffs in specific\ncommunities;\n\u2022 CONA\u2019s community engagement and record of supporting community partners, as well\nas the contents of and process by which CONA developed its community benefits plan\n(CBP), CONA\u2019s performance on a prior CBP developed as part of its previous merger\nwith ING, and the impact of the Bank Merger on Discover Bank\u2019s community\ndevelopment lending.\nConcentration in Credit Markets and Potential Price Effects Related to the Bank Merger\nThe OCC received mixed comments on the extent to which the Bank Merger would\nmeaningfully increase concentration in consumer credit markets, especially in the markets for\ncredit cards in general and subprime credit cards in particular, as well as structural and business-\nspecific factors that may exacerbate or mitigate this concentration. Commenters also expressed\nviews on whether the Bank Merger would cause the Resulting Bank to have sufficient market\npower to increase prices for consumers, with a particular focus on LMI and subprime credit card\nconsumers.\nMultiple commenters expressed concerns that large bank mergers have historically led to\nincreased fees and other costs for consumers and reduced small business lending. In particular,\nmany of these commenters focused on the credit card market, citing to various Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reports for the propositions that the credit card market is\nalready highly concentrated in the top ten issuers and that large issuers both offered worse\ninterest rates across credit scores and were more likely to charge annual fees than smaller issuers.\nCONA\u2019s response challenged the CFPB\u2019s conclusions on concentration in the credit card market,\nand took issue with the CFPB\u2019s methodology, and thus its findings asserting that there are only\nmarginal gaps between the largest and smallest issues when differences due to credit unions,\nprogram type and program credit risk profile are controlled for. Separately, CONA also stated\nthat technological and product developments have added to competitive pressures in the credit\ncard market (e.g., buy now pay later offerings, peer-to-peer payment providers, and fintech-\nsponsored personal loans), and that there are relatively few barriers to entry, either for new\nissuers or established issuers offering new products. As such, CONA stated that, because many\nconsumers have access to multiple payment options, CONA is increasingly competing not only\nat the point of card origination, but at the point of each transaction.\nMore specific to the Bank Merger, other commenters stated that the Resulting Bank would\nbecome the nation\u2019s largest credit card lender, and that the Bank Merger would substantially\nAppendix, page 2 increase the concentration of credit card lending in the four largest issuers. Some commenters by\ncontrast stated that CONA already has sufficient market power to affect prices, stating that its\ncredit card rates are on average higher than Discover Bank\u2019s. Many commenters also focused\nmore narrowly on the subprime credit card market as a distinct market, stating the\nResulting Bank would hold a substantial portion of outstanding loans to borrowers with\nsubprime scores, an amount materially larger than that of competitors. One commenter, for\nexample, provided Herfindahl\u2013Hirschman Index (HHI) calculations that they stated show that, in\nthe subprime credit card loan market, the Bank Merger would exceed thresholds for further\nscrutiny established in guidelines published by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ)\nand Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Some commenters further stated that the subprime credit\ncard market has structural features that would prevent the Resulting Bank\u2019s customers from\nmoving to competitors, including the smaller number of products available to subprime\nconsumers versus prime consumers, balance transfer fees, credit score inquiries and closed\naccounts leading to consumer credit score reductions, and the time needed for consumers to\nnavigate these factors. These commenters further noted that the Bank Merger would remove\nDiscover Bank as a key competitor in the subprime lending market. According to these\ncommenters, these factors could provide the Resulting Bank with the market power to effectively\nraise prices for all their customers, but especially LMI and subprime borrowers and\nDiscover Bank\u2019s current customers.\nBy contrast, some commenters stated that the Bank Merger could allow the Resulting Bank to\ncompete more effectively against the largest banks and credit card issuers, which could drive\ninnovation and reduce costs across the market. Some of these commenters also noted that the\nsize of the credit card market is a countervailing, pro-competition factor to consider. For\nexample, one commenter pointed to the thousands of depository institutions and credit card\nissuers nationwide and the relatively moderate share of purchases with credit cards issued by the\nlargest issuers when compared to total credit card purchase volume. This commenter stated that\ntheir analysis shows that the increased market share of the Resulting Bank would not trigger\nthresholds inviting closer scrutiny under various federal bank merger guidelines. Finally, this\ncommenter also noted challenges with viewing the subprime credit card market as a distinct,\nrelevant market given changes in consumers\u2019 credit scores over time.\nIn response, CONA stated that the credit card market is intensely competitive and will remain so\nafter the Bank Merger, citing to over 5,000 credit card issuers of all sizes and business models\nthat compete on numerous terms and benefits, and a decline in market concentration over the\npast decade related to both credit card balances and purchase volumes. CONA represented that,\nas stated in the Application, the Bank Merger will not in fact exceed concentration thresholds set\nout in either of the 1995 bank merger guidelines or the 2023 DOJ and FTC merger guidelines.\nCONA represented that the Bank Merger will allow it to increase access to credit, including for\nLMI consumers. CONA cited to several competitors and products focused on the subprime\nmarket (e.g., secured credit cards, financial technologies (fintechs) using data to identify unmet\ncredit needs) and the growth of non-credit card options that can provide access to subprime\nconsumers (e.g., debit cards, buy now pay later offerings). CONA also represented in the\nApplication that several developments in the credit card market have greatly increased the ability\nof consumers to switch to other issuers (e.g., online banking and online credit card applications,\nAppendix, page 3 applications based on \u201csoft\u201d credit inquiries that do not affect a consumer\u2019s credit rating, balance\ntransfer allowances, and cards with no annual fees).\nFinally, regarding credit card prices, CONA pointed to its history of not charging foreign\ntransaction, overlimit, activity, inactivity, closed account, alerts, account opening, statement\nreprinting, paper statement, authorized user, or expedited payment fees. As discussed in greater\ndetail below, CONA also represented that the integration with the affiliated payment network is\nexpected to improve the Resulting Bank\u2019s product offerings and increase its competitive stance\nvis-\u00e0-vis larger bank competitors.\nConcentration in Payments Markets and Potential Price Effects Related to the Bank Merger and\nthe COFC-DFS Merger\nThe OCC received mixed comments on the extent to which the COFC-DFS merger would\nmeaningfully increase concentration in the payments market industry, as well as structural and\nbusiness-specific factors that may exacerbate or mitigate this concentration. Commenters also\nexpressed views on whether the COFC-DFS merger could result in COFC having sufficient\nmarket power to increase networks fees, which would be borne by merchants, and indirectly by\nconsumers, as well as whether and how the regulation of debit card interchange fees may allow\nor incentivize these fee increases. While the payments network portion of COFC\u2019s business\nfollowing the merger will not reside within CONA or directly affect competition in the federal\nbanking system, many of these commenters nonetheless expressed views that the payments\nnetwork businesses would nonetheless implicate the statutory factors that the OCC must consider\nfor the Bank Merger. Accordingly, we have considered these comments as well.\nSome commenters voiced support for the Bank Merger on the grounds that COFC and the\nResulting Bank may be able to compete more effectively with the largest players in the payments\nnetwork industry, enhancing innovation, decreasing fees, and potentially generating cost-saving\nefficiencies that could be reinvested in efforts to increase financial access to LMI communities.\nOther commenters opposing the Bank Merger stated that the payments network industry is\nalready highly concentrated and questioned COFC\u2019s and CONA\u2019s ability to make the affiliated\npayments network materially more competitive. These commenters stated that any changes in the\nmarket share of the largest payment networks would be based simply on CONA\u2019s strategic\ndecision to transfer its debit card and (eventually) credit card business to the affiliated payments\nnetwork, rather than reflecting increased competition or incentives to provide better services.\nIn response, CONA emphasized that COFC does not currently own or operate a payments\nnetwork and that the COFC-DFS merger will lead to increased competition in the payments\nnetwork industry. CONA cited to the current high level of concentration in the payments\nnetwork industry, with the top three players representing 96 percent of U.S. credit card purchase\nvolume. CONA represented that if the Bank Merger is approved, it plans to move all of its debit\ncard and a meaningful amount of its credit card volumes to the affiliated payments network by\n2027. CONA further represented that COFC will invest significantly in the affiliated payments\nnetwork\u2019s merchant acceptance, brand awareness, technology, network integrity (including\npayment and fraud dispute resolution processes), and risk management and compliance\ncapabilities.\nAppendix, page 4 Commenters opposing the Bank Merger stated that the COFC-DFS merger would provide COFC\nand the Resulting Bank the ability to raise network fees for debit and credit transactions on the\naffiliated payments network. These commenters stated that increased network fees would be\nborne by merchants (who would likely be unable to reject the Resulting Bank\u2019s cards given the\nbank\u2019s market position) and, indirectly, by consumers, as merchants pass on these costs via\nincreased prices. Some commenters further stated that if COFC wanted to grow the affiliated\npayments network, it would need to attract business from other banks that issue their own cards,\nand that the most effective way to achieve this would be to offer higher-than-market interchange\nfees to these issuers, which again would be borne by merchants and, indirectly, consumers.\nSome commenters further stated that COFC and the Resulting Bank would have an incentive to\nraise network fees on debit card purchases as a result of \u201ccircumventing\u201d the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s\nDurbin Amendment and the FRB\u2019s implementing regulations. See 15 USC 1693o-2 and\n12 CFR Part 235 (Regulation II)). In particular, some commenters stated that transaction fees on\nDiscover Bank\u2019s debit cards are higher than debit cards that run on four-party networks (those\nsubject to regulatory caps on interchange fees). These commenters stated that the Resulting Bank\nwould maintain these higher rates. Accordingly, these comments expressed concern that given\nCONA\u2019s migration of its debit card products to the affiliated payments network, a greater\npercentage of merchants\u2019 business would be subject to these higher transaction fees.\nBy contrast, commenters supporting the Bank Merger stated that the Durbin Amendment led\nbanks to eliminate or reduce debit card rewards programs, and that by moving its debit card\npayments to a three-party system, the Resulting Bank would be better placed to invest its\nincreased share of transaction fees into more competitive customer rewards and in maintaining\nfree checking accounts for LMI customers. One commenter also claimed that any incentive to\nraise debit card transaction fees would be balanced by merchants\u2019 ability to not accept\nResulting Bank\u2019s cards, which would make the business less attractive to consumers and lessen\nthe COFC\u2019s and the Resulting Bank\u2019s ability to compete in the payments network industry.\nCONA represented that COFC does not intend to increase any fees on the affiliated debit or\ncredit payment networks as a result of the Bank Merger. It noted that, post-merger, the network\nwill remain the smallest network for credit card transactions, and even though it intends to move\nall of CONA\u2019s debit card transaction volumes to the affiliated payments network, the\nResulting Bank will account for only 6.5 percent of U.S. debit transaction volume, far behind the\ntwo largest payments networks, which combined accounted for 85 percent of 2023 debit\npurchase volumes. Regarding allegations that the COFC-DFS merger will allow the\nResulting Bank to \u201ccircumvent\u201d debit card interchange fee caps, CONA stated that this\nmisrepresents the relevant law. CONA noted that in a three-party system, there is no\n\u201cinterchange\u201d fee to regulate, as the network and the issuing bank are commonly held. CONA\nalso stated that neither the volume of debit transactions on the affiliated payments network nor\nthe Resulting Bank\u2019s share of the checking account market, from which debit card purchases\nderive, would provide COFC sufficient market power to force merchants to accept unreasonable\nincreases in network fees. CONA further stated that because it would no longer need to pay a\nnetwork fee to a third party, it would be able to lower its overall per-transaction costs, which it\nAppendix, page 5 may invest in offerings such as access to no-fee, no-minimum-balance checking accounts or cash\nbonuses to new checking account customers.\nCONA\u2019s Business Model and Practices\nSeveral commenters expressed concern that the Bank Merger would disproportionately burden\nLMI and nonwhite communities. These commenters expressed concern regarding CONA\u2019s:\n\u2022 high pricing of credit products compared to other lenders;\n\u2022 aggressive debt collection practices, citing to reports that no lender sues more of its\ncustomers than CONA, that these suits are more likely to involve predominantly Black\ngeographies, that CONA has recovered more in amounts that had already been\ncharged-off than any other credit card lender, that CONA gives insufficient review of\naffidavits required in debt collection lawsuits, and that CONA has entered settlements in\nseveral private lawsuits and public enforcement actions regarding these practices;\n\u2022 raising of credit caps unilaterally, which these commenters stated is a contributing factor\nto a rise in persistent credit card debt;\n\u2022 handling of consumer complaints and customer service practices, including that CONA\nhas one of the highest levels of credit card and other complaints based on a CFPB\ndatabase; and\n\u2022 rewards and their applicability to LMI borrowers.\nRegarding its pricing practices, CONA noted that access to credit cards is an essential part of\nfully engaging with the broader financial services ecosystem and represented that it works with\ncustomers to help them build their credit safely. CONA noted that its business practices must be\nseen through the lens of its decision to serve LMI and subprime consumers that many other\nlenders are unable or unwilling to serve. CONA stated that these accounts require a greater level\nof scrutiny and resources to underwrite and manage. However, CONA represented that its credit\nproducts compare favorably to other lenders that serve these communities, citing to its lack of\naccount opening fees, credit line increase fees, authorized user fees, monthly statement fees,\nreplacement card fees, or foreign transaction fees. CONA further represented that it was the first\nof the largest retail banks to eliminate all overdraft and non-sufficient fund fees for consumer\nbanking products.\nRegarding concerns about its debt collection practices, CONA responded that comparing its\nvolume of credit card complaints to other lenders is misleading owing to CONA\u2019s size and\nbusiness model. Specifically, it cited its strategic decision to lend to a greater percentage of\ncustomers who may be facing financial challenges. CONA further stated that its ability to\nprovide credit to those with no or less credit experience or who are rebuilding their credit\ndepends on it being able to collect debts owed and minimize losses. However, CONA\nrepresented that it takes several steps throughout the credit lifecycle to help its customers manage\ntheir accounts. These include: using holistic upfront underwriting practices; offering subprime\nproducts with initially low lines of credit and limited fees; investing in technology that allows\nCONA to connect and work with struggling customers digitally; connecting distressed customers\nAppendix, page 6 with external support, including credit counseling agencies and groups that help consumers\nrebuild their credit following a debt management plan; and offering financial literacy programs.\nAdditionally, CONA represented that legal judgment volumes have fallen significantly since\n2018 due to its revision of criteria for instituting debt collection civil suits. CONA further\nrepresented that its percentage of charge-offs that are sent to civil suit recoveries are below\nindustry benchmarks.\nRegarding its practice of unilaterally raising customers\u2019 credit limits, CONA stated that, rather\nthan burdening customers, these practices can improve a customer\u2019s credit score by increasing\ntheir available credit and lowering their utilization rate. However, CONA stated that customers\nare able to decline these increases. CONA represented that its CBP includes a plan to provide a\nstreamlined ability to opt out of proposed credit line increases.\nRegarding customer complaints, CONA contested citations solely to the number of customer\ncomplaints, stating that this fails to take into account CONA\u2019s sizeable customer base and its\nfocus on popular retail products like credit cards and auto loans, as compared to its competitors.\nAdditionally, CONA represented that a meaningful portion of its CFPB-logged complaints are\nrequests to remove accurate negative information from customers\u2019 credit reports, which CONA\nhas only limited ability to honor under the law.\nRegarding customer service, CONA stated that it ranks highly among banks in customer\nsatisfaction, representing that it ranked highest in overall customer satisfaction in J.D. Power\u2019s\n2024 U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. CONA represented that it has identified a broad\nset of similarities between its practices and Discover Bank\u2019s, and that, where it has identified\ndifferences that drive positive customer outcomes, it intends to preserve these features. As an\nexample, CONA represented that it intends to invest in replicating Discover Bank\u2019s \u201cLive Agent\nChat\u201d capabilities for all customers following the Bank Merger.\nFinally, commenters had mixed views on the effect of the Bank Merger on CONA\u2019s current or\npotential rewards program offerings. Several commenters supported the Bank Merger on the\nbasis that it could lead to improved rewards programs (including for Discover Bank customers).\nFor example, one commenter expressed the view that CONA could use fees from expanding the\naffiliated payment network to offer enhanced rewards (potentially even on debit cards, for which\nmost banks have eliminated rewards programs) and maintain free checking accounts for LMI\nconsumers.\nBy contrast, other commenters expressed concern that the benefits of rewards programs are\nunequally distributed and tend to transfer wealth from consumers with lower credit scores to\nthose with higher credit scores. These commenters voiced concern that this results in a transfer of\nwealth away from consumers with lower incomes or educational attainment or who live in higher\nminority geographies due to the relationship between credit score and demographic\ncharacteristics. These commenters cited statistics showing that higher credit score borrowers\naccount for a disproportionately high percentage of credit card rewards redemptions, while\nsubprime borrowers account for a disproportionately lower percentage. Further, these\ncommenters stated that rewards programs can obscure the true cost of borrowing and encourage\nhigher levels of unsustainable borrowing. Other commenters expressed concern that any\nAppendix, page 7 enhanced rewards programs will be at the expense of merchants paying higher network fees, as\ndiscussed above.\nIn response, CONA cited data indicating that rewards card ownership has grown the fastest\namong the LMI customer segment since 2020, and that, as of 2023, rewards utilization is nearly\nidentical between LMI and upper-income cardholders. CONA further cited to products it offers\nto new-to-credit and subprime customers that have cash-back rewards programs.\nCompliance with Laws and Regulations\nMultiple commenters pointed to a number of consent orders, enforcement actions, lawsuits, and\nother actions, by multiple regulators and private litigants, related to compliance violations by\nboth CONA and Discover Bank over the past two decades. In particular, commenters cited to\npast actions related to AML, consumer protection, and discrimination laws, as well as to data\nsecurity breach incidents. These commenters expressed concern that these actions demonstrate a\npattern of willful behavior by CONA and Discover Bank and that CONA is likely to continue\nthis behavior following the Bank Merger.\nBy contrast, some commenters stated that the Bank Merger will allow the Resulting Bank to\ninvest more in stronger protections of customers\u2019 data. One commenter, for example, noted that\nintegrating its operations into the affiliated payments network will reduce data fragmentation that\ncan undermine fraud detection. However, some commenters negatively compared CONA\u2019s\nprivacy practices and protections to Discover Bank\u2019s.\nIn response, CONA represented that it has committed significant investments to strengthen its\nrisk management and compliance functions to address past compliance issues. It added that it is\ncommitted to investing continually in its compliance management capabilities and building its\nculture around compliance as a priority.\nCONA also noted that because Discover Bank is a smaller bank than CONA, it is currently\nsubject to a lower tier of prudential supervisory standards. However, as a result of the\nBank Merger, Discover Bank\u2019s operations will be brought under CONA\u2019s existing enhanced\nsupervisory standards. See, e.g., 12 CFR Part 252 (enhanced prudential standards: Discover Bank\nis part of a \u201cCategory IV\u201d banking organization, while CONA is part of a \u201cCategory III\u201d banking\norganization, which is generally subject to a higher level of regulatory requirements). CONA\nrepresented that it plans to make significant investments to enhance the compliance and risk\nmanagement infrastructure at Discover Bank in line with these enhanced standards.\nRegarding comments specific to AML, information security, and fraud, CONA further\nrepresented that:\n\u2022 its AML program is robust and administered in a safe and sustainable manner, utilizing\ntechnology investments in machine learning for transaction monitoring, next-generation\ncustomer risk rating processes, and modern investigator platforms;\n\u2022 it has made extensive investments in risk management, cybersecurity, and resilience,\nincluding through talent acquisition and overhauling its control environment; and\nAppendix, page 8 \u2022 it has planned investments in improved fraud detection and prevention technologies,\nwhich it stated will lead to reduce transaction prices for issuers, consumers, and\nmerchants.\nCONA further stated that, as a three-party-system, it has an enhanced incentive to improve fraud\ndetection and prevention since it bears a greater share of the cost of loss, as compared to the\nmore dispersed liability in a four-party-system (due to the higher number of parties involved).\nFinancial Condition and Financial Stability\nSeveral commenters expressed concern that the Bank Merger would create or otherwise\nexacerbate risk to the Resulting Bank\u2019s financial condition or to the financial stability of the U.S.\nThese commenters highlighted three categories of concern.\n\u2022 Too Big to Fail: Some commenters noted that following the Bank Merger, the\nResulting Bank would be the largest credit card lender in the U.S., would be the sixth\nlargest bank in terms of consolidated domestic assets, and would have the fifth largest\nbank holding company. These commenters voiced concern that the business and assets of\nsuch a large bank could not easily be transferred to other banks, and that the\nResulting Bank would in essence be \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Some commenters further\nsupported the too big to fail argument by noting that the Resulting Bank would be\nsignificantly larger than the banks that were granted a systemic risk exception during the\nMarch 2023 regional bank failures. In contrast, other commenters noted that the\nResulting Bank would hold only 3 percent of all domestic assets, which is small\ncompared to other large U.S. banks.\n\u2022 Asset Quality and Concentration: Several commenters pointed out that CONA is already\nheavily dependent on earnings related to its credit card products. According to these\ncommenters, the proportion of the Resulting Bank\u2019s assets represented by credit card\nloans (as well as certain other similar ratios) would be meaningfully in excess of other\nmajor credit card lenders. These commenters stated that this concentration would expose\nthe Resulting Bank to heightened risk in an economic downturn, which it could spread to\nother financial institutions given its size.\n\u2022 Borrower Risk Profile: Some commenters further expressed concern that the\nResulting Bank\u2019s credit card lending will be additionally concentrated in subprime loans,\nwhich tend to have a higher delinquency rate. These commenters stated that this risk\nprofile could expose the Resulting Bank to heightened risk in an economic downturn,\nwith some commenters stating that credit card delinquencies and charge offs have been\nrising industry-wide and more specifically that CONA and Discover Bank have\nhigher-than-average credit card delinquency and charge-off rates compared to other large\nbanks.\nIn response to the first category, CONA stated that several regulatory and supervisory metrics\ndemonstrate that the Bank Merger will not meaningfully increase systemic risk. Specifically,\nCONA represented that the Resulting Bank\u2019s pro forma \u201cMethod 1 [global systemically\nimportant bank (GSIB)] score\u201d as of December 31, 2023, would be in the low 30s, well below\nthe score at which a bank is considered systemically important. See 12 CFR 217.402. CONA also\nAppendix, page 9 represented that the Bank Merger will not lead to a meaningful increase in any of the five metrics\nthe FRB uses to evaluate a bank holding company\u2019s systemic risk. Further, CONA noted that\nCOFC\u2019s combined GSIB score would be dwarfed by the score of existing U.S. GSIBs and would\nbe on the low end compared to many of its large domestic regional bank peers. Specifically,\nCONA noted COFC would (1) have a balance sheet well shy of the national deposit cap of\n10 percent or the national liabilities cap of 10 percent; (2) offer retail and commercial deposit\nproducts, credit cards, payment services, consumer and commercial loan products, and treasury\nmanagement services, each of which are non-specialized offerings for which there are numerous\nactive competitors; (3) not have trading or business activities that significantly interconnect its\nbusiness with other financial institutions; (4) have limited cross-jurisdictional activity; and\n(5) have neither a complex organizational structure nor significant holdings of illiquid assets.\nCONA further represented that it is already subject to enhanced capital and liquidity\nrequirements, which it has historically satisfactorily met and will continue to meet, and that the\nassets of Discover Bank would be brought under this stricter regime as a result of the\nBank Merger. See, e.g., the capital adequacy and liquidity risk measurement standards set out in\n12 CFR parts 3 and 50, respectively applicable to a \u201cCategory III national bank\u201d such as CONA\n(12 CFR 3.2, 252.5(d))\u2014Discover Bank, as a \u201cCategory IV\u201d bank (12 CFR 252.5(e)), is not\ncurrently subject to these requirements).\nFinally, CONA stated that its business model and supervisory regime differentiate it from the\nbanks that contributed to the 2023 regional bank failures. Specifically, it cited to its diversified\nbusiness model, high proportion of FDIC-insured deposits, and long history of operating within a\nbanking organization subject to enhanced supervisory standards. See, e.g., 12 CFR Part 252\n(enhanced prudential standards).\nRegarding the asset quality and concentration and borrower risk profile comments, CONA\nrepresented (in addition to the above factors) that its historic performance demonstrates the\nbank\u2019s and its business model\u2019s resilience, while differentiating the nature of its subprime loans\nfrom competitors. Specifically, CONA cites to its history successfully weathering past crises,\nincluding the 2007-08 financial crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, and 2023 regional banking failures,\nas well as the results of FRB stress tests. CONA also represented that Discover Bank has a lower\nproportion of subprime loans than CONA does, and the Bank Merger will thus decrease the\nResulting Bank\u2019s current percentage of subprime loans. Finally, CONA reiterated its\ncommitment to lending to the full spectrum of consumers, differentiating its subprime assets\nfrom those of many competitors. That is, CONA represented that its strategy is undergirded by\npolicies and practices designed to govern subprime lending in a safe and sound manner; by\ncontrast, it stated, many peers\u2019 subprime asset holdings are a result of credit deterioration.\nBranches and Employee Retention\nCommenters expressed concerns that CONA will close branches as a result of the Bank Merger,\nincluding in LMI communities and communities of color. In particular, commenters pointed to\nCONA\u2019s record of closing branches it acquired in past mergers, including branch closings\nfollowing transactions with Hibernia National Bank, North Fork Bancorp, and\nChevy Chase Bank, and highlighted branch closures in specific geographies, including Texas and\nVirginia. Commenters also stated that CONA\u2019s branch presence in low-income census tracts and\nAppendix, page 10 geographies with predominantly Black and Hispanic populations has decreased since 2009.\nThese commenters expressed concern that these closures have led to a loss of access to retail\nbanking services that has harmed affected communities.\nIn response to commenters, CONA acknowledged branch closures in Louisiana, Texas,\nNew Jersey, Connecticut, and New York since 2006, but stated that focusing solely on branch\nclosures is misleading given consumer preferences and the significant shift over that period to\nmobile and other digital channels. Specifically, CONA stated that its branch strategy has focused\non a blend of in-person and digital channels (including Capital One Caf\u00e9s staffed by personnel\nwho can assist with certain services), reductions in product fees, strategic partnerships to expand\nits national reach (e.g., third-party ATM access, fee-free deposit capabilities through partnerships\nwith national pharmacies), and financial literacy and awareness programs that help customers\nnavigate the CONA\u2019s tools. CONA represented that this strategy has led to an increase in access\nto its banking products and services and an increase in deposits.\nCONA also represented that its branch network in LMI areas has increased in every successive\nCRA examination period since 2010 and now outperforms most peers. CONA stated that it\ncommitted in its CBP to maintaining at least 30 percent of its retail locations (branches and\ncaf\u00e9s) in LMI neighborhoods, as well as to opening three new caf\u00e9 locations in LMI areas.\nCONA\u2019s Application stated that there are no planned branch closures in connection with the\nBank Merger. Discover Bank does not have an overlapping branch footprint with CONA, having\nonly a main office in Greenwood, Delaware, which CONA committed in the Application to\nretaining as a branch. Finally, CONA represented that since its 2007-2010 CRA exam period,\nonly 20 percent of branch closures have been in LMI areas.\nRelatedly, commenters expressed concern that the Bank Merger would lead to significant\nlayoffs, pointing to CONA\u2019s representations that the Bank Merger would result in significant\noperating and marketing synergies. In particular, several commenters highlighted certain\ncommunities where employees could be exposed to layoffs, including Illinois, Delaware, and\nOhio. Commenters supported their concerns by citing to layoffs in California and North Dakota\nthat occurred following CONA\u2019s 2012 acquisition of HSBC\u2019s credit card operations.\nCONA acknowledged that it will need to examine the staffing requirements of the\nResulting Bank should the Bank Merger be approved, and that CONA may seek to realize\nefficiencies where certain roles, functions, or costs are duplicative. However, in response to\ncomments and community engagements, CONA also stated that as part of the CBP, it has\ncommitted to retain specific operations and employees in: Whitehall, Ohio; Chatham, Illinois;\nand Greenwood, Delaware. Moreover, CONA stated that it has committed to not laying off any\nof Discover Bank\u2019s front-line associates. CONA further represented that its workforce has\nconsistently grown since 2005.\nCONA\u2019s Community Engagement and CBP and Discover Bank\u2019s Community Development\nLending\nOn July 17, 2024, CONA announced a CBP that commits $265 billion in lending, investing and\nphilanthropy over five years. CONA stated that it participated in almost weekly discussion\nAppendix, page 11 sessions from April through July 2024 with four lead community organizations that collectively\nrepresent over 800 nonprofits in developing its CBP, and that these partners helped assess over\n130 proposals. Additionally, CONA represented that its CBP reflects input from its 30-member\nCommunity Advisory Council, nationwide listening sessions with community organizations in\nIllinois, Delaware, New York, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, District of Columbia, and\nCalifornia, and input from over 100 elected officials. CONA also represented that it invited other\ncommunity groups to participate, but that these groups declined the offer.\nSeveral commenters voiced support for the CBP or for CONA\u2019s and Discover Bank\u2019s current\ncommunity engagement and investments, including in LMI geographies. Commenters mentioned\nexamples including employee volunteer work; support for nonprofits, small businesses, and\ncommunity development financial institutions; and philanthropy, especially in Delaware, Illinois,\nand Virginia.\nSome commenters, however, expressed concerns with the CBP, such as with the amount of new\nfunding commitments or with the lack of commitments on subjects such as interest rates and\nfees. Still other commenters expressed concern with the process by which the CBP was formed,\nciting the use of nondisclosure agreements. Finally, a number of commenters expressed concern\nabout CONA\u2019s commitment to its CBP based on its history of implementing a previous plan\nrelated to its 2012 acquisition of ING Direct. Specifically, commenters pointed to CONA\u2019s 2017\ndecision to exit mortgage lending prior to meeting its mortgage lending commitments under the\nprevious plan.\nCONA responded that the CBP includes significant new community development lending and\ninvestment commitments and represents an expansion of CONA\u2019s offering of products and\nservices to underserved small businesses and consumers in LMI communities. Regarding the\nING community benefits plan, CONA stated that its decision to largely exit mortgage lending\nwas based on its inability to successfully compete with nonbank mortgage lenders, despite\ninvesting significant resources.\nSome commenters also expressed concerns that the Bank Merger would jeopardize\nDiscover Bank\u2019s CRA community development lending and investment programs, including\naffordable housing investments. CONA stated that it has consistently ranked among the banks\nwith the highest community development lending for the past decade. It represented that its CBP\nalso includes new community development lending and investment commitments. The\nResulting Bank\u2019s community development lending and investments will continue to be routinely\nevaluated under the CRA following the Bank Merger.\nFinally, some commenters requested that the OCC condition approval of the Bank Merger on\nCONA complying with the CBP. Although under the CRA, the OCC evaluates a bank\u2019s record\nof meeting the credit needs of its entire community, neither the CRA nor the BMA requires that a\nbank engage in any particular type of activity or enter agreements with third parties. The OCC\ndoes not monitor compliance with nor enforce these agreements. See \u201cInteragency Questions and\nAnswers Regarding Community Reinvestment,\u201d 81 Fed. Reg. 48,506 (July 25, 2016)\n(Q&A \u00a7 __.29(b) -2).\nAppendix, page 12",

The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are: Order of Prohibition against Alhassan Abubakar, former Associate Banker at a New York, New York, branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Columbus, Ohio, for misappropriating $20,000 from the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-08) Order of Prohibition against Jacqueline Molina, former Customer Service Representative at TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for fraudulently obtaining over $40,000 in Paycheck Protection Program funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-11) Order of Prohibition against Nick Zatikian, former Associate Banker at a Tujunga, California, branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Columbus, Ohio, for embezzling at least $34,900 from the bank and altering the bank's internal records to conceal his embezzlement.

The OCC will combine the Midsize and Community Bank Supervision and Large Bank Supervision functions to create the Bank Supervision and Examination line of business. Blending the large, midsize and community bank supervision activities will allow for the seamless sharing of expertise and resources to address bank-specific issues or novel needs and provides opportunities for career development and progression for the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire examination workforce. Beverly Cole, the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Midsize and Community Bank Supervision, will retire in May after 43 years of supervision, regional and programmatic leadership at the OCC. Greg Coleman, Senior Deputy Comptroller for Large Bank Supervision, will lead the Bank Supervision and Examination office. The OCC will also reinstate the Chief National Bank Examiner office which will include the divisions of Bank Supervision Policy as well as Supervision Risk and Analysis. Organizing risk identification, analysis and policy efforts will ensure a seamless approach to knowledge sharing and supervision. Grovetta Gardineer, the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy, will retire in May after 37 years of federal service, including 15 years at the OCC providing counsel, direction, and oversight of critical OCC policies and supervisory plans. Jay Gallagher, the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Supervision Risk and Analysis, will lead the Chief National Bank Examiner Office. The OCC also announced that it is elevating its Information Technology and Security (ITS) function to be led by a new Senior Deputy Comptroller for ITS, who will serve as a member of the Executive Committee. These organizational changes will be effective on June 2, 2025. Media ContactStephanie Collins (202) 649-6870 Topic(s): About OCC",

It is both a privilege and a pleasure to address this distinguished group once again\u2014this\ntime in my capacity as Acting Comptroller of the Currency. The members of this organization\nrepresent the very heartbeat of our nation\u2019s vibrant and evolving financial services ecosystem.\nServing as Acting Comptroller is a profound honor and a solemn responsibility. Every\nday, I am focused on fulfilling the OCC\u2019s historic mission: ensuring a safe, sound, and fair\nfederal banking system that serves the needs of all Americans. I remain firmly convinced that our\nfederal banking system is\u2014and must continue to be\u2014a pillar of strength for our nation and its\neconomy.\nThe story of the OCC is in many ways the story of America\u2019s financial resilience.\nEstablished in 1863 with the passage of the National Currency Act\u2014signed into law by President\nAbraham Lincoln\u2014the OCC was created to bring coherence and confidence to a fragmented\nbanking system. President Lincoln recognized that a unified, reliable national currency and\nbanking framework were essential to building a stronger, more prosperous union.\nToday, more than 160 years later, the OCC continues to safeguard that vision. I have the\nhonor of leading a dedicated team of 3,600 professionals who oversee more than 1,040 national banks and federal savings associations, collectively holding nearly $16 trillion in assets. It is a\nresponsibility I do not take lightly.\nMy own journey in financial services began humbly\u2014as an accounting intern at Arthur\nAndersen while still in high school. After graduating from the University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill, I spent time as a missionary in Zambia and Zimbabwe, contemplating a call to the\nEpiscopal priesthood. While I ultimately found my vocation elsewhere, the desire to serve others\nremained constant, and I have carried it with me throughout my career in community banking,\ncommercial lending, and economic development.\nPublic service has been an enduring thread in that journey. In 2003, President George W.\nBush appointed me Deputy Administrator of the Rural Housing Service at the U.S. Department\nof Agriculture. I later served as Vice Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, and\nthen returned to the NCUA as Chairman in 2019 under President Trump. Along the way, I have\nalso served on the board of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and on the boards of several\nfintech companies\u2014experiences that continue to inform my perspective at the OCC.\nSince assuming the role of Acting Comptroller two months ago, I have advanced four key\nareas of strategic focus:\n1. Reducing regulatory burden,\n2. Promoting financial inclusion,\n3. Embracing bank-fintech partnerships, and\n4. Expanding responsible bank activities involving digital assets.\n2 Each of these priorities underscores the enduring value of the federal charter and affirms\nour commitment to modernizing the banking system without compromising its safety and\nintegrity.\n1. Reducing Regulatory Burden\nFrom my first day as Acting Comptroller, I have emphasized a guiding principle:\nRegulations must be effective, not excessive. Our regulatory framework should safeguard the\npublic interest while enabling banks\u2014especially community institutions\u2014to thrive and innovate.\nWe reject a one-size-fits-all model. Instead, the OCC applies a risk-based approach to\nsupervision, tailoring oversight according to each bank\u2019s size, complexity, business model, and\nrisk profile. This ensures that every national bank and federal savings association benefits from\nan individualized supervisory strategy\u2014aligned with both its challenges and its potential.\n2. Promoting Financial Inclusion\nI have often said\u2014and continue to believe\u2014that financial inclusion is the civil rights\nissue of our time. Consider the 40 percent of American households that cannot cover a $400\nemergency expense, or the nearly 70 million individuals who are credit invisible. Without access\nto fair and affordable financial services, they remain vulnerable\u2014to predatory lenders, to\neconomic shocks, and to exclusion from opportunity.\nTo meet this challenge, the OCC launched Project REACh\u2014the Roundtable for\nEconomic Access and Change. This collaborative initiative brings together leaders in banking,\ncivil rights, community development, and technology to forge creative and sustainable solutions\nto close the access gap.\n3 Our newly restructured Office of External Relations and Strategic Partnerships, under the\nleadership of my Chief of Staff and the National Director for Project REACh, Andrew Moss,\nwill continue to advance this work. Together, we are developing a comprehensive financial\ninclusion strategy that enlists the entire financial ecosystem in the effort to expand opportunity\nand promote shared prosperity.\n3. Embracing Bank\u2013Fintech Partnerships\nIn today\u2019s digital age, innovation is not optional\u2014it is essential. Financial technology,\nwhen deployed responsibly, can broaden access, enhance efficiency, and deepen relationships\nbetween banks and their customers.\nAt the OCC, we have long embraced a forward-looking approach to innovation. We were\nthe first federal bank regulatory agency to establish an Office of Innovation in 2016. Today, that\nvision continues through our Office of Financial Technology, a team of dedicated experts who\nserve as a resource for banks and fintechs alike.\nThis team supports our work in regulatory sandboxes, virtual office hours, and\nTechSprints\u2014initiatives designed to keep pace with the rapidly evolving financial landscape. We\nrecently issued a conditional approval for a national bank\u2019s business model transformation to\nfocus on providing a nationwide, technology-enabled small business lending platform\u2014\nillustrating the type of responsible innovation we are committed to supporting.\n4. Expanding Responsible Bank Activities Involving Digital Assets\nMore than 50 million Americans now hold some form of cryptocurrency, and digital\nassets continue to represent hundreds of billions of dollars in financial activity. The digitalization\nof financial services is not a trend\u2014it is a transformation.\n4 In response, the OCC has provided clear and prudent guidance. Our issuance of\nInterpretive Letter 1183 confirms that national banks may engage in certain digital asset\nactivities, provided they do so safely and soundly and under appropriate risk management\nstandards. This guidance offers a framework for innovation while maintaining our high\nexpectations for compliance and consumer protection.\nNational banks and federal savings associations are well positioned to engage in this\nspace responsibly. And with the expertise of our Office of Financial Technology, we stand ready\nto support banks that wish to explore these emerging opportunities.\nClosing\nAs I prepare to transition into a fireside conversation with Faith Schwartz, I want to take\na moment to acknowledge the extraordinary work of the men and women of the OCC. Their\nprofessionalism, expertise, and commitment to public service have enabled all we have\naccomplished over these past two months. The federal banking system is safe, sound, and fair\nthanks to their dedication.\nI am grateful for the opportunity to serve alongside them\u2014and grateful to the Exchequer\nClub for the opportunity to share our vision with you today.\nThank you.\n5",

The OCC provided public notice of the unauthorized access and its designation as a major information security incident on April 8, 2025. The OCC is committed to taking all actions to remediate the deficiencies that contributed to this incident and to ensure full accountability for any organizational or structural deficiencies that contributed to this incident.

    "cleaned_text":"April 14, 2025\nSubject: OCC Information Security Incident\nDear CEO:\nOn April 8, 2025, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), in accordance with the Federal\nInformation Security Modernization Act (FISMA), notified Congress that it identified a major incident\nresulting from a breach of the OCC\u2019s email system. The breach occurred when an unauthorized user\naccessed a number of OCC user accounts, including emails and attachments, via a service account with\nadministrative-level privileges. The OCC immediately disabled the unauthorized account and is now\ndetermining what data has been accessed, including the extent to which highly sensitive information\nrelating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions was compromised. The OCC\nhas also deployed enhancements and improvements to IT security to ensure a robust data security\nenvironment.\nBackground: On February 11, 2025, Microsoft Global Hunting Oversight and Strategic Triage (GHOST)\nnotified the OCC that they observed unusual interactions between a service account in Microsoft\u2019s\nAzure office automation environment and OCC user mailboxes hosted by Microsoft. Authentications to\nthis service account were tracked to a location associated with a commercial Virtual Private Network\n(VPN) service.\nOn February 12, the OCC confirmed the activity was unauthorized and immediately activated its incident\nresponse protocols. This included initiating an independent third-party forensics and incident\nassessment of the breach by Mandiant and reporting the incident to the Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA) as required per M-25-04. The OCC subsequently secured the\nservices of CrowdStrike to conduct a similar investigation.\nDuring its extensive internal review, the OCC learned that the unauthorized access involved sensitive\ninformation. On April 7, the OCC determined the incident qualified as a major incident under FISMA.\nOCC Response: In response to the unauthorized activity, the OCC disabled the compromised service\naccount and confirmed the unauthorized access had been terminated. The OCC also globally reset all\ncredentials associated with its full Microsoft tenant to eliminate the possibility of further unauthorized\naccess by this threat actor. At this time, the OCC has confirmed the universe of the compromised email\nmailboxes, dates of compromise, and messages and attachments accessed during the incident. Efforts to\nanalyze the compromised email messages to determine their contents have been initiated and are\nongoing.\nThe OCC is configuring and hardening its Microsoft 365 environment in alignment with secure baseline\nrequirements issued under Binding Operational Directive 25-01, \u201cImplementing Secure Practices for Cloud Services.\u201d The OCC has also enhanced oversight of the contractor-led management of the\nMicrosoft email environment.\nAs mentioned above, the OCC has partnered with Microsoft GHOST, as well as Mandiant and\nCrowdStrike, well known cybersecurity forensics firms, to perform a full investigation relating to the\nincident. Mandiant and CrowdStrike have both reviewed all activity within OCC\u2019s Microsoft Cloud tenant\nand verified there has been no indication of additional activity or lateral movement within OCC IT\nsystems by the threat actor. On April 10, Mandiant further confirmed the breached account existed\nsolely in the cloud environment, and their analysis found no evidence of compromise affecting other\naccounts in the tenant.\nTechnical information on the nature of the attack and indicators of compromise will be shared via U.S.\nTreasury in an OCCIP circular, on the Project Fortress Threat Feed platform and also through FS-ISAC.\nFurther, the OCC is expeditiously working to engage outside counsel to thoroughly evaluate the OCC\u2019s\ncurrent IT security policies and procedures to improve its ability to prevent, detect, and remediate\npotential security incidents going forward. The OCC is committed to acting on recommendations made\nas a result of the evaluation.\nThe OCC and one of its contractors are currently working to review the content of all compromised\nemail communications and attachments, including determining whether any of the compromised\ninformation has been found on the dark web. Information that was accessed includes financial\nsupervision information provided by OCC supervised institutions and non-public OCC information.\nEfforts to determine if any bank customer information was compromised are ongoing.\nWhat you can expect: The OCC is committed to ensuring its supervised institutions are informed of its\nefforts to address the breach and to fortify its information security systems. To this end, the OCC will\nhost regular meetings with regulated banks, savings associations, and service providers to ensure open\nlines of communication and share current information about findings and the status of efforts underway\nto resolve the incident.\nThe OCC will inform each regulated institution if it determines the unauthorized user accessed\ninformation specific to that institution for their awareness. The OCC also will provide all supervised\ninstitutions with email user domains that were included in the compromised information so they may\ndetermine what information or data they may have sent to OCC users during the timeframe of the\nunauthorized access.\nThe OCC is engaging with industry Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to discuss industry best\npractices to further ensure the security of its systems.\nIn an abundance of caution, Mandiant is currently conducting a thorough review of both BankNet and\nthe Large File Transfer (LFT) system which many regulated institutions use to share supervisory\ninformation. While OCC conducts regular penetration tests and security assessments on BankNet and\nother OCC communication systems, we have requested this additional comprehensive review to confirm its security. The OCC will share information from Mandiant when this review has been completed. The\nOCC has requested CrowdStrike conduct a similar assessment and will also share their findings.\nWe recognize regulated institutions may have questions about their provision of requested supervisory\ninformation for OCC examinations. OCC examiners are available to work with individual institutions to\nanswer their questions and ensure the secure exchange of required supervisory information.\nThe OCC is committed to the security of its information systems and will take every action necessary to\nensure remediation of the deficiencies that contributed to this incident and to ensure full accountability\nfor any organizational or structural deficiencies that contributed to this incident.\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to your EIC or portfolio manager.\nSincerely,\nRodney E. Hood\nActing Comptroller of the Currency\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency",

This action is expected to allow banks and credit unions to work with families and businesses without obtaining an appraisal. Banks and credit unions will still be required to determine that the value of the real estate supports the institution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to enter into the transaction. As a result of this action, financial institutions will be better able to lend or modify loans in areas where wildfire and straight-line wind damage has made appraisals challenging to obtain. This action is also expected to reduce loan processing times, helping to facilitate recovery from the disaster. This action will expire on January 8, 2028. The agencies will monitor institutions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 real estate lending practices to ensure the transactions are being conducted in a safe and sound manner.

This finding is the result of internal and independent third-party reviews of OCC emails and email attachments that were subject to unauthorized access. On February 11, 2025, the OCC learned of unusual interactions between a system administrative account in its office automation environment and OCC user mailboxes. On February 12, the OCC confirmed the activity was unauthorized and immediately activated its incident response protocols which include initiating an independent third-party incident assessment and reporting the incident to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. On February 12, the OCC disabled the compromised administrative accounts and confirmed that the unauthorized access had been terminated. The OCC provided public notice of the incident on February 26. After confirming the unauthorized activity, the OCC immediately began analyzing the compromised email messages to determine their contents. These efforts included using internal data science experts and independent third-parties and are ongoing. While that review is ongoing, based on the content of the emails and attachments reviewed thus far, the OCC, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, determined the incident met the conditions necessary to be classified as a major incident. The OCC discovered that the unauthorized access to a number of its executives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 emails included highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions used in its examinations and supervisory oversight processes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe confidentiality and integrity of the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information security systems are paramount to fulfilling its mission,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have taken immediate steps to determine the full extent of the breach and to remedy the long-held organizational and structural deficiencies that contributed to this incident. There will be full accountability for the vulnerabilities identified and any missed internal findings that led to the unauthorized access.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The OCC has utilized third-party cybersecurity experts to perform a full review of the investigation and forensics efforts. The OCC is also launching an immediate and thorough evaluation of its current IT security policies and procedures to improve its ability to prevent, detect and remediate potential security incidents going forward. In addition, the OCC is working to engage an additional independent third-party to assess and analyze internal processes related to cyber incidents. Throughout its review, the OCC has coordinated with the Department of the Treasury to share information about its findings. Media ContactStephanie Collins (202) 649-6870 Topic(s): About OCC",

    "cleaned_text":"Acting Comptroller Rodney E. Hood\nRemarks at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition\nJust Economy Conference 2025\n\u201cInnovation Fosters Financial Inclusion\u201d\nMarch 27, 2025\nThank you for the invitation to appear at the Just Economy Conference today to address\nthis august membership. I have always had a very endearing relationship with NCRC\u2014starting\nfrom my time as a Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) officer. One of my fondest memories\nwill always be my trip to France with John Taylor, Irv Henderson, and Pete Garcia to engage\nwith and educate international organizations on the utility of the CRA and how it supports the\nflow of capital into underserved communities and results in meaningful community outcomes.\nHow far we have all come since that time! Today I am honored to serve as Acting\nComptroller of the Currency, a role that represents an extraordinary privilege and solemn\nopportunity to advance the OCC\u2019s historic mission of ensuring a safe, sound, and fair federal\nbanking system that serves all Americans. As many in this room are aware, my interest in\nfinance began with an accounting internship during high school. Following my graduation from\ncollege, I explored a different path and spent time as a missionary in Zimbabwe, which led me to\nconsider a future as an Episcopal priest.\nUltimately, I transitioned into banking and finance, specializing in commercial lending,\ncommunity development, and economic development. My career has spanned nearly three\ndecades, including positions at three Wall Street firms as well as another federal regulator. The Importance of Financial Inclusion\nIn every role I\u2019ve focused on the importance of financial inclusion for underserved\ncommunities because I know how transformative it can be when people gain access to quality,\naffordable financial services and credit.\nMake no mistake: financial inclusion is the civil rights challenge of our generation.\nThat\u2019s why my focus on this has been unwavering, and I encourage innovative thinking among\nstakeholders in financial services about how we can lead the way to foster greater financial\ninclusion in economically disadvantaged communities. During my tenure as the NCUA\nChairman, I made financial inclusion a priority for the agency and the cooperative credit system.\nI continue to champion this topic at the OCC because I truly believe national banks and federal\nsavings associations should help all people to access our financial mainstream.\nA bank account is a starting point in financial inclusion, not an end point. This first bank\naccount can lead to longer-term savings, access to credit, 401(k) and other retirement accounts,\nand wealth-building opportunities. Banks can provide this access through small dollar loans that\nhelp consumers meet short-term needs and build their credit history. Inclusion also means\nproviding the much-needed capital for mortgage lending and other lines of retail credit to\nconsumers.\nBuilding banking relationships with consumers through investment in financial literacy\nand capability training is a start. The number of households that do not have more than $400 in\nsavings is alarming, and more must be done to increase the awareness and importance of\npersonal money management. There are numerous reports that argue for more financial\neducation to help families and workers save and build wealth while avoiding financial traps.\n2 Private-sector financial partners should take the lead in expanding financial literacy training,\nincluding collaborating with community and faith-based organizations, to make these programs\nmore widely available.\nNext, I believe supporting small businesses and entrepreneurship is a key factor toward\nestablishing an economic foundation in any community. Small businesses are the backbone of\neconomic viability. They help to create the opportunities for employment and commerce that\nattract capital investments. The paycheck protection program administered by financial services\nproviders kept many Main Street businesses afloat during a time of extreme stress. It also proved\nthe use case and significant community value in providing access to affordable business capital.\nFinancial services providers can help businesses build and expand by providing technical\nassistance and innovative tools, products and services geared toward helping small enterprises\nget access to the capital they need.\nAnother approach to increasing financial inclusion is leveraging the potential of financial\ntechnology. Fintech has shown great promise for improving efficiency and customer service,\nespecially as convenience drives the increasing numbers of banking customers into a digital\nworld. These same fintech tools can be used to provide banks with analytical tools to explore\ncustomer cash flow analysis and spending habits\u2014data that can be used to leverage products that\ncan facilitate bank lending decisions as well as materials to incentivize consumer savings. The\npace of financial technology development means that connecting financial providers with\neconomically disadvantaged communities and further increasing access to affordable financial\nservices knows no bounds.\nAdditionally, building generational wealth is founded in homeownership. Buying a home\nhelps members of economically disadvantaged communities to access the American Dream and\n3 own an asset to build equity that can ultimately provide opportunities for starting a small\nbusiness or paying for an education. However, financial inclusion should not just focus on\nbuying a home. Maintaining and preserving generational assets, such as a family home or farm,\nis just as crucial to ensuring opportunities for economic mobility.\nOver the past few years, housing affordability has deteriorated. Between 2020 and 2024,\nmedian family income increased by 24.6 percent. However, during the same period, home prices\nrose by 45 percent\u2014nearly double the average five-year home price appreciation since 1980,\naccording to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Housing price growth\nhas moderated in the past two years, with the year-on-year growth in late 2024 close to long-term\naverages.\nMortgage interest rates have also climbed from approximately 3 percent in late 2021 to a\nrange of 6 to 7 percent in recent years, according to Freddie Mac. Higher home prices and\nincreasing interest rates have contributed to affordability challenges, with the share of median\nhousehold gross income needed to buy an average-priced home increasing to 35 percent, above\nthe historical average of 24 percent. According to the American Community Survey, 5.6 million\nhouseholds with a mortgage, or 11 percent of all households with a mortgage, spent more than\nhalf of their gross income on housing costs in 2023.\nWe must recognize there\u2019s no \u201csilver bullet\u201d to immediately solve the challenges of\nfinancial inclusion and affordable homeownership. However, we can carefully consider a\ncomprehensive agenda that firmly roots financial inclusion for underserved and disadvantaged\ncommunities at its core.\n4 The OCC\u2019s Project REACh: Successes and Future Work\nThat\u2019s why I am proud to highlight the financial inclusion efforts of the OCC\u2019s Project\nREACh. Project REACh\u2014which stands for the Roundtable for Economic Access and Change\u2014\nbrings together leaders in banking, civil rights, community development, and technology to\nidentify innovative solutions to financial inclusion for economically disadvantaged communities.\nIt is an initiative that has demonstrated enormous impact.\nFor example, through REACh convenings, financial institutions developed an affordable\ncredit solution for consumers who were unable to access credit because they lacked a credit file\nand did not have a credit score. This resulted in more than 100,000 accounts established under\nthis pilot.\nOther innovations related to cash flow underwriting are especially promising. Several\nbanks have begun piloting tools that analyze consumers\u2019 habits in making deposits and paying\nbills as a means of determining their ability to manage debt for credit underwriting purposes.\nThis creates a range of opportunities for those who lack a FICO score and are \u201ccredit invisible.\u201d\nToday, several national banks have undertaken a pilot program to expand the use of\nalternative, non-FICO data\u2014primarily from deposit accounts\u2014to qualify credit-impaired\nconsumers for affordable lines of credit and bring them into the regulated financial system.\nThe success of this pilot shows how outcomes can be accelerated and expanded through\nfuture collaboration and engagement.\nThis leads me to tell you more about how the OCC is refocusing and dedicating its\nProject REACh efforts to support financial inclusion. Over the past five years, the OCC provided\na forum for industry and community leaders to collaborate on developing innovative solutions,\n5 primarily centered on areas that were key to community and economic development topics. As\nwe recognize an evolving financial landscape, we need to ensure that all communities are\nafforded the opportunity for economic inclusion and mobility. This means we need to educate\nconsumers about the opportunities and risks related to digital assets and create technical\nassistance vehicles that could lead to accessing affordable credit for new entrepreneurs and gig\neconomy workers.\nWe will focus our work on four key workstreams:\nThe first is Affordable Homeownership, which will address the challenges I highlighted\nearlier that disadvantaged and underserved consumers face in purchasing homes and encourages\nthe development of innovative products and services that improve access to credit.\nThe second workstream will encompass a range of opportunities for Small Businesses\nand work to increase investments and financing to these business owners and entrepreneurs.\nThird, the Technology Workstream explores expanding financial inclusion through new\ntechnologies or novel uses of existing technologies. Additionally, the participants in this\nworkstream will collaborate to educate consumers about digital assets so no one is left out of the\nrapidly expanding digital economy.\nAnd the fourth workstream will focus on Geographic-specific efforts addressing unique\neconomic challenges facing specific neighborhoods, communities, or regions through promoting\nholistic development strategies for locales along with community lenders, such as minority\ndepository institutions and community development financial institutions.\n6 Conclusion\nThis work cannot be done in a vacuum and takes collaboration and partnership with\norganizations like NCRC that play a vital role. So today I am happy to announce the\nrestructuring of an OCC office that will drive this collaborative effort. Our new Office of\nExternal Relations and Strategic Partnerships will be led by Andrew Moss, my Acting Chief of\nStaff and the agency\u2019s National Director for Project REACh. Andrew will be responsible for\ndeveloping our comprehensive financial inclusion strategy. This office will also engage with\ncritical external stakeholders to identify economic barriers, build partnerships, promote\neducation, and encourage responsible innovation to foster increased inclusion in the federal\nbanking system.\nIn closing, I know there are many Project REACh participants in the room, and I want to\npersonally thank you for your commitment and contributions to the initiative. There is still much\nthat needs to be done, and we welcome your help in creating solutions that will promote\neconomic opportunity and mobility for all communities.\nThank you.\n7",

    "cleaned_text":"Acting Comptroller Rodney E. Hood\nRemarks at the Homeownership and Housing Policy Conference\nNational Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals\nMarch 24, 2025\nGood afternoon, esteemed colleagues, distinguished guests, and members of the National\nAssociation of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP).\nIt is an honor to join you today at this Homeownership and Housing Policy Conference.\nThis marks the 25th anniversary of NAHREP, a milestone celebrating a quarter century of\ndedication to expanding homeownership opportunities, financial empowerment, generational\nwealth, and economic mobility. This gathering serves as a testament to our shared commitment\nto advancing homeownership. As a longtime friend of NAHREP, I\u2019m excited to share insights\ninto the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\u2019s (OCC) priorities for 2025, which include\nfinancial inclusion, and regulatory developments impacting homeownership.\nAt the OCC, our mission is to ensure that national banks and federal savings associations\noperate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair access to financial services, treat customers\nfairly, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Central to this mission is our\nunwavering dedication to financial inclusion, a priority that I, as Acting Comptroller, hold in the\nhighest regard.\nThe story of the OCC and the national banking system begins in 1863, when the National\nCurrency Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln. As President Abraham Lincoln said in a message to Congress in 1864, the national banking system\nwill \u201ccreate a reliable and permanent influence in support of the national credit.\u201d\nToday, financial inclusion is more than just a regulatory objective; it is a cornerstone of\neconomic empowerment. It ensures that individuals and communities have access to the financial\ntools and resources necessary to build wealth, invest in education, start businesses, and,\nimportantly, achieve homeownership. Homeownership, as many of you know, is not merely\nabout possessing property; it is about establishing roots, fostering community, attaining financial\nstability, and creating opportunities for generational wealth.\nGenerational wealth\u2014meaning the assets passed down from one generation to the next\u2014\nplays a pivotal role in breaking the cycle of poverty and building economic resilience.\nHomeownership has historically been one of the most effective vehicles for accumulating and\ntransferring such wealth. However, systemic barriers have long prevented many underserved\ncommunities from accessing homeownership opportunities, thereby hindering their ability to\nbuild and sustain wealth over generations.\nRecognizing these challenges, the OCC launched Project REACh\u2014or the Roundtable for\nEconomic Access and Change\u2014in July 2020. This initiative convenes leaders from banking,\nbusiness, technology, and community organizations to identify and reduce barriers that prevent\nunderserved communities from fully participating in our economy. Through collaborative efforts,\nProject REACh aims to dismantle systemic barriers and promote innovative solutions that\nadvance financial inclusion.\nOne of the critical areas of focus for Project REACh is affordable homeownership. By\naddressing the challenges that disadvantaged and underserved consumers face in purchasing\n2 homes, and by encouraging the development of innovative products and services that improve\naccess to credit, we strive to make homeownership attainable. This endeavor is not just about\nincreasing homeownership rates; it is about ensuring that the dream of owning a home, and the\nassociated benefits of stability and wealth creation, is accessible to every individual, regardless\nof their background or economic status.\nI want to express my deep appreciation for the work that NAHREP and its members do\nevery day. Your dedication to promoting sustainable homeownership in the community and\nbeyond is instrumental in shaping a more equitable housing landscape. Together, by aligning our\nefforts and sharing our expertise, we can create pathways to financial inclusion and generational\nwealth.\nThank you again for hosting this event today. I look forward to diving deeper into the\nchallenges and opportunities we face as we work together to advance financial inclusion and\ngenerational wealth in our fireside chat.\n3",

The\ncharacteristics of the loans included here may differ from the overall population. The loans\nincluded are not a statistically representative, random sample.\n\u2022 This report covers the performance of first-lien home mortgages in the portfolios of reporting\nbanks. It excludes junior liens, home equity lines of credit (HELOC), and home equity\nconversion mortgages (reverse mortgages).\n\u2022 For loans with forbearance activity covered by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\nSecurity (CARES) Act, reporting banks are following guidance from the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the respective\ngovernment agencies and government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) for the calculation and\nreporting of delinquency and credit bureau reporting.\n1 The seven national banks are Bank of America, Citibank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, PNC, U.S. Bank, and Wells\nFargo.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 1 Executive Summary\nOverall Mortgage Portfolio and Performance\n\u2022 As of December 31, 2024, the reporting banks serviced approximately 11.1 million first-lien\nresidential mortgage loans with $2.7 trillion in unpaid principal balances (see figures 1 and\n2). This $2.7 trillion was 20.2 percent of all residential mortgage debt outstanding in the\nUnited States.2\n\u2022 Overall mortgage performance this quarter improved from the fourth quarter of 2023. The\npercentage of mortgages that were current and performing at the end of the fourth quarter of\n2024 was 97.3 percent compared with 97.2 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023\n(see figure 6). The CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and ended on\nMay 11, 2023, allowed for loan forbearance that could extend up to November 30, 2023, and\nis reflected in the mortgage performance data.\n\u2022 Servicers initiated 6,647 new foreclosures in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease from a\nyear earlier (see figure 7). Home forfeiture actions during the fourth quarter of 2024\u2014\ncompleted foreclosure sales, short sales, and deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure actions\u2014decreased\n26.9 percent from a year earlier to 1,398 (see figure 8). Events associated with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, including foreclosure moratoriums that began March 18, 2020, and\nended July 31, 2021, have significantly affected these metrics.\nNumber and Type of Modifications Completed and Impact on Payment\nAmount\nServicers completed 7,332 modifications during the fourth quarter of 2024, a 1.6 percent\ndecrease from the previous quarter\u2019s 7,450 modifications.\n\u2022 Of these 7,332 modifications, 6,872, or 93.7 percent, were \u201ccombination modifications\u201d\u2014\nmodifications that included multiple actions affecting the affordability and sustainability of\nthe loan, such as an interest rate reduction and a term extension. Of the remaining 460 loan\nmodifications, 444 received a single action and 16 were not assigned a modification type (see\ntable 1).\n\u2022 Among the 6,872 combination modifications completed during the quarter, 5,818, or\n84.7 percent, included a term extension; 5,643, or 82.1 percent, included capitalization of\ndelinquent interest and fees; 3,322, or 48.3 percent, included an interest rate reduction or\nfreeze; 2,177, or 31.7 percent, included principal deferral; and 4, or 0.1 percent, included\nprincipal reduction (see table 2).\n\u2022 Of the 7,332 modifications completed during the quarter, 3,789, or 51.7 percent, reduced the\nloan\u2019s pre-modification monthly payment (see table 3).\n2 Residential mortgage debt is determined using the quarterly Federal Reserve Statistical Release, \u201cZ.1: Financial\nAccounts of the United States,\u201d table L.218, \u201cOne-to-Four-Family Residential Mortgages,\u201d household sector\nliabilities. Data as of December 31, 2024.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 2 Modified Loan Performance\nBy December 31, 2024, all loans modified during the second quarter of 2024 would have aged at\nleast six months. Of the 7,488 modifications completed during the second quarter of 2024,\nservicers reported that 2,087, or 27.9 percent, were 60 or more days past due or in the process of\nforeclosure at the end of the month that the modification became six months old (see table 4).\nFigure 1 shows the outstanding principal balance of reported loans and the change in outstanding\nprincipal balances from the fourth quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024.\nFigure 1: Total Serviced Mortgage Portfolio\u2014Outstanding Principal in Billions of Dollars\n$2,900\n$2,851\n$2,850\n$2,809\n$2,800 $2,779 $2,769\n$2,750 $2,733 $2,739 $2,748 $2,755 $2,744\n$2,700\n$2,650\n$2,600\n$2,550\n$2,500\n$2,450\n$2,400\n4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24\nFigure 2 shows the number of first-lien residential mortgages serviced and the change in the\nnumber of loans serviced from the fourth quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024.\nFigure 2: Total Serviced Mortgage Portfolio\u2014Number of Loans in Thousands\n12,250\n12,045 12,008 12,032\n12,000\n11,783\n11,731\n11,750\n11,500\n11,500\n11,279\n11,180\n11,250\n11,072\n11,000\n10,750\n10,500\n10,250\n10,000\n4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 3 Figure 3 shows the number of loans in each risk category and the change in each category from\nthe fourth quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024.\nFigure 3: Composition\u2014Loans in Thousands by Borrower Risk Category\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n0\n4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24\nOther 243 238 244 239 235 230 224 219 215\nSubprime 152 148 148 145 140 137 134 133 131\nAlt-A 201 198 200 196 192 188 184 181 178\nPrime 11,448 11,423 11,441 11,203 11,164 10,945 10,737 10,647 10,548\nFigure 4 reports the percentage of loans in each risk category and shows that the composition of\nloans remained stable since the fourth quarter of 2022.\nFigure 4: Composition\u2014Percentage of Mortgages by Borrower Risk Category\n2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2%\n100%\n1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1%\n2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2%\n80%\n60%\n95% 95% 95% 95% 95% 95% 95% 95% 95%\n40%\n20%\n0%\n4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24\nPrime Alt-A Subprime Other\nFigure 5 shows the number of loans in each category of delinquency from the fourth quarter of\n2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024.

For example, these loans may lack high loan-to-value mortgage insurance,\nhave minimal documentation, or be secured by collateral other than the borrower\u2019s primary\nresidence. Alt-A mortgages are based on the borrower\u2019s credit conditions at origination.\nCapitalization: Actions that increase the unpaid principal balance of the loan by the amount of\nany delinquent payments and fees.\nCombination modifications: Modifications that include more than one type of modification\naction. Most modifications generally require changes to more than one term of a loan to bring a\nloan current and reduce monthly payments to an amount that is affordable and sustainable.\nForeclosures in process: Mortgages for which servicers have begun formal foreclosure\nproceedings but have not yet completed the foreclosure process. The foreclosure process varies\nby state. Many foreclosures in process never result in the loss of borrowers\u2019 homes because\nservicers simultaneously pursue other loss mitigation actions, and borrowers may return their\nmortgages to current and performing status.\nInterest rate reductions and freezes: Actions that reduce or freeze the contractual interest rate\nof the loan that was in effect before the modification action.\nLoan modifications: Actions that contractually change the terms of mortgages with respect to\ninterest rates, maturity, principal, or other terms of the loan.\nOther: Mortgages in the portfolio that could not be classified by the bank as Prime, Alt-A, or\nSubprime. Other mortgages are based on the borrower\u2019s credit conditions at origination.\nPrime: Mortgages to borrowers underwritten as part of a conforming or jumbo loan program.\nTypically, these borrowers are eligible for standard loan programs and pricing. For example,\nborrowers typically have mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value exceeds 80 percent of the\ncollateral property value. Prime mortgages are based on the borrower\u2019s credit conditions at\norigination.\nPrincipal deferral modifications: Modifications that remove a portion of the unpaid principal\nfrom the amount used to calculate monthly principal and interest payments for a set period. The\ndeferred amount becomes due at the end of the loan term.\nPrincipal reduction modifications: Modifications that permanently reduce the unpaid principal\nowed on a mortgage.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 11 Re-default: For purposes of this report, a loan is defined as in re-default if it was 60 or more\ndays past due as of the end of the month at which the modification was six months old. For\nexample, a loan that was modified as of November 1, 2019, would be defined as in re-default if it\nwas 60 or more days past due or 30 or more days past due and in the process of foreclosure as of\nits May 31, 2020, reporting date.\nSeriously delinquent loans: Mortgages that are 60 or more days past due and all mortgages held\nby bankrupt borrowers whose payments are 30 or more days past due.\nSubprime: Mortgages to borrowers that display a range of credit risk characteristics that may\ninclude a weak credit history, reduced repayment capacity, or incomplete credit history. A weak\ncredit history may include prior delinquencies, judgments, bankruptcies, or foreclosures on the\ncredit report at the time of underwriting. Subprime mortgages are based on the borrower\u2019s credit\nconditions at origination.\nTerm extensions: Actions that extend the final maturity date of the loan that was in effect before\nthe modification action.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report Method\nLoan delinquencies are reported using the Mortgage Bankers Association convention that a loan\nis past due when a scheduled payment has not been made by the due date of the following\nscheduled payment. The statistics are based on the number of loans, unless stated otherwise.\nPercentages are rounded to one decimal place unless the result is less than 0.1 percent, which is\nrounded to two decimal places. The report uses whole numbers when approximating. Values in\ntables may not total 100 percent because of rounding.\nResults are not seasonally adjusted.\nOCC Mortgage Metrics Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 12",

During the fourth quarter of 2024, four large\ncommercial banks represented 86.5 percent of the total banking industry notional amounts and\n71.1 percent of industry net current credit exposure (NCCE).\nThe OCC and other supervisors have dedicated examiners at the largest banks to continuously\nevaluate the credit, market, operational, reputation, and compliance risks of bank trading and\nderivatives activities. In addition to the OCC\u2019s supervisory activities, the agency works with\nother financial supervisors and major market participants to address infrastructure, clearing, and\nmargining issues in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. OCC activities include development of\nobjectives and milestones for stronger trade processing and improved market transparency across\nderivative categories, migration of certain highly liquid products to clearinghouses, and\nrequirements for posting and collecting margin.\nThis is the 117th edition of the OCC\u2019s Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives\nActivities. The first report was published in 1995. Please send any comments or feedback on the\nstructure and content of this report to QuarterlyDerivatives@occ.treas.gov.\nExecutive Summary\n\u2022 Insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations (collectively, banks) reported\ntrading revenue of $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, $1.8 billion less (10.6 percent)\nthan in the previous quarter and $3.1 billion more (26.7 percent) than a year earlier (see\ntable 1).\n\u2022 Initial credit exposure from derivatives before netting decreased in the fourth quarter of 2024\ncompared with the third quarter of 2024, while NCCE increased $33 billion, or 14.1 percent,\nto $270.0 billion (see table 5).\n\u2022 Derivative notional amounts decreased in the fourth quarter of 2024 by $32.2 trillion, or\n14.7 percent, to $186.5 trillion (see table 10).\n\u2022 Derivative contracts remained concentrated in interest rate products, which totaled\n$125.9 trillion or 67.5 percent of total derivative notional amounts (see table 10).\n1 Values in the tables and figures in this report may not add up to the totals because of rounding.\n2 Institutions with less than $5 billion of total assets have the option to file the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC) 051 call report. Due to the limited amount of derivatives data provided by FFIEC 051\ncall report filers, this report provides this information separately and distinctly in table 25 in the appendix.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 1 Revenue\nInsured U.S. Commercial Banks and Savings Associations\u2019 Trading\nRevenue\nInsured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations reported $14.8 billion in trading\nrevenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, $1.8 billion less (10.6 percent) than in the previous quarter\nand $3.1 billion more (26.7 percent) than a year earlier (see table 1). The quarter-over-quarter\ndecrease in trading revenue was due to decreases in revenue from interest rate, equity, and\ncommodity and other instruments.

Since the 2008 financial crisis and the adoption\nof bank holding company charters by the former investment banks, the percentage of bank\ntrading revenue to consolidated BHC trading revenue has generally declined, resulting in a\nmedian of 44 percent over the past 17 years. This decline reflects the significant amount of\ntrading activity by the former investment banks that, while included in BHC results, remains\noutside insured commercial banks. More generally, insured U.S. commercial banks and savings\nassociations have more limited legal authorities than their holding companies, particularly in the\ntrading of commodity and equity products.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, banks generated 71.4 percent of consolidated holding company\ntrading revenue, an increase from 47.7 percent in the previous quarter (see figure 1).\nFigure 1: Bank Trading Revenue as a Percentage of Consolidated Holding Company Trading Revenue\nSource: Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies\u2014FR Y-9C (Schedule HI) and call report (Schedule RI)\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nCounterparty credit risk is a significant risk in bank derivative trading activities. The notional\namount of a derivative contract is a reference amount that determines contractual payments, but\nit is generally not an amount at risk. The credit risk in a derivative contract is a function of\nseveral variables, such as whether counterparties exchange notional principal, the volatility of the\nunderlying market factors (interest rate, currency, commodity, equity, or corporate reference\nentity), the maturity and liquidity of the contract, and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.\nCredit risk in derivatives differs from credit risk in loans because of the more uncertain nature of\nthe potential credit exposure. Because the credit exposure is a function of movements in market\nfactors, banks do not know\u2014and can only estimate\u2014how much the value of the derivative\ncontract might be at various points in the future.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 3 The credit exposure is bilateral in most derivative transactions, such as swaps (which make up\nthe bulk of bank derivative contracts). Each party to the contract may (and, if the contract has a\nlong enough tenor, probably will) have a credit exposure to the other party at various times\nduring the contract\u2019s life. With a funded traditional loan, the amount at risk is the amount\nadvanced to the borrower. The credit risk is unilateral as the bank faces the credit exposure of the\nborrower.\nMeasuring credit exposure in derivative contracts involves identifying those contracts a bank\nwould lose value on if the counterparty to a contract defaulted. The total of all contracts with\npositive value (i.e., derivative receivables) to the bank is the gross positive fair value (GPFV)\nand represents an initial measurement of credit exposure. The total of all contracts with negative\nvalue (i.e., derivative payables) to the bank is the gross negative fair value (GNFV) and\nrepresents a measurement of the exposure the bank poses to its counterparties.\nGPFV decreased by $53.0 billion (2.2 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2024 to $2.4 trillion,\nprimarily driven by a $241.0 billion (15.6 percent) decrease in receivables from interest rate\ncontracts and a $31.0 billion (14.9 percent) decrease in receivables from equity contracts (see\ntable 3a). GNFV decreased $114.0 billion (4.7 percent) to $2.3 trillion during the quarter, driven\nby a $251.0 billion (17.0 percent) decrease in payables from interest rate contracts and a\n$38.0 billion (16.2 percent) decrease in payables from equity contracts (see table 3b).\nTable 3a: Gross Positive Fair Values, in Billions of Dollars\nQ\/Q Q\/Q % Y\/Y Y\/Y %\nTrading instruments 4Q 2024 3Q 2024 Change Change 4Q 2023 Change Change\nInterest rate $1,301 $1,541 -$241 -15.6% $1,331 -$30 -2.2%\nFX $828 $595 $233 39.1% $614 $214 34.9%\nEquity $176 $207 -$31 -14.9% $149 $27 18.3%\nCommodity and other $40 $55 -$15 -27.4% $42 -$2 -4.6%\nCredit $43 $42 $1 2.1% $36 $7 19.8%\nGPFV $2,387 $2,441 -$53 -2.2% $2,171 $216 10.0%\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-L\nTable 3b: Gross Negative Fair Values, in Billions of Dollars\nQ\/Q Q\/Q % Y\/Y Y\/Y %\nTrading instruments 4Q 2024 3Q 2024 Change Change 4Q 2023 Change Change\nInterest rate $1,227 $1,478 -$251 -17.0% $1,274 -$47 -3.7%\nFX $800 $608 $192 31.7% $629 $171 27.3%\nEquity $195 $233 -$38 -16.2% $158 $37 23.4%\nCommodity & other $36 $51 -$15 -28.9% $41 -$5 -12.0%\nCredit $46 $49 -$3 -6.8% $42 $4 9.5%\nGNFV $2,305 $2,419 -$114 -4.7% $2,144 $160 7.5%\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-L\nNote: Numbers may not add up to total due to rounding.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 4 A legally enforceable netting agreement between a bank and a counterparty creates a single legal\nobligation for all transactions (called a \u201cnetting set\u201d) under the agreement. Therefore, when\nbanks have such agreements with their counterparties, contracts with negative values (an amount\na bank would pay to its counterparty) can offset contracts with positive values (an amount owed\nby the counterparty to the bank), leaving an NCCE as shown in table 4.\nTable 4: Netting Contract Examples\nNumber of Value of\nBank A portfolio with Counterparty B contracts contracts Credit measure\/metric\nContracts with positive value to Bank A 6 $500 GPFV\nContracts with negative value to Bank A 4 \u2013$350 GNFV\nTotal contracts 10 $150 NCCE to Bank A from Counterparty B\nMost derivative transactions that a bank has with an individual counterparty are subject to a\nlegally enforceable netting agreement. Some transactions may be subject to the laws of a\njurisdiction that does not provide legal certainty of netting agreements, in which case banks must\nregard such transactions as separate from the netting set. Other transactions may involve\nnonstandard contractual documentation. Transactions that are not subject to the same legally\nenforceable netting agreement have distinct values that cannot be netted and for which the\nappropriate current credit measure is the gross exposure to the bank if that amount is positive.\nWhile banks can net exposures within a netting set under the same netting agreement, they\ncannot net exposures across netting sets without a separate legally enforceable netting\nagreement. As a result, a bank\u2019s NCCE to a particular counterparty equals the sum of the GPFV\nof contracts less the dollar amount of netting benefits with that counterparty. A bank\u2019s NCCE\nacross all counterparties equals the sum of its NCCE to each of its counterparties.\nNCCE is the primary metric the OCC uses to evaluate credit risk in bank derivative activities.\nNCCE for insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations increased by $33 billion\n(14.1 percent) to $270 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 (see table 5).3 Legally enforceable\nnetting agreements allowed banks to reduce GPFV exposures by 88.7 percent ($2.1 trillion) in\nthe fourth quarter of 2024.\nTable 5: Net Current Credit Exposure, in Billions of Dollars\nQ\/Q Q\/Q %\nNetting benefit ratio 4Q 2024 3Q 2024 change change\nGPFV $2,387 $2,441 -$53 -2.2%\nNCCE RC-R $270 $237 $33 14.1%\nNetting benefit RC-R $2,118 $2,204 -$87 -3.9%\nNetting benefit % RC-R 88.7% 90.3% -1.6%\nSource: Call reports, Schedules RC-L and RC-R\n3 Banks report NCCE on two different schedules (RC-R and RC-L) of the call report, and the amounts reported are\nnot the same because of differences in the scope of coverage. Neither measure comprehensively captures NCCE.\nRC-L includes exposure only from OTC derivative transactions; it excludes exchange-traded transactions. RC-R\nexcludes transactions not subject to capital requirements. This report uses RC-R to measure NCCE.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 5 NCCE peaked at $804.0 billion at the end of 2008 during the financial crisis when interest rates\nhad plunged and credit spreads were very high (see figure 2). The decline in NCCE since 2008\nhas largely resulted from declines in the GPFV of interest rate and credit contracts. After a large\nincrease in NCCE during the first quarter of 2020 as markets responded to the financial impact of\nthe COVID-19 global pandemic, NCCE ended the fourth quarter of 2024 at $270.0 billion\nexhibiting more normal market activity.\nFigure 2: Net Current Credit Exposure, in Billions of Dollars\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-R\nThe bulk of NCCE in the financial system is concentrated in banks and securities firms (39.1\npercent) and in corporations and other counterparties (55.3 percent) (see table 6). The combined\nexposure to hedge funds and sovereign governments was small (5.6 percent in total).\nTable 6: Net Current Credit Exposure by Counterparty Type as a Percentage of Total Net Current Credit\nExposure\nCorporations and\nBanks and Sovereign other\nQuarter securities firms Hedge funds governments counterparties\n4Q 2024 39.1% 2.1% 3.5% 55.3%\n3Q 2024 37.6% 2.3% 5.3% 54.9%\n2Q 2024 39.9% 1.5% 4.0% 54.5%\n1Q 2024 38.9% 1.4% 4.5% 55.2%\n4Q 2023 34.6% 2.3% 5.0% 58.1%\n4Q 2022 34.5% 2.3% 3.9% 59.2%\n4Q 2021 37.9% 2.0% 7.4% 52.6%\n4Q 2020 39.1% 2.2% 8.3% 50.4%\n4Q 2019 44.2% 2.5% 9.2% 44.1%\n4Q 2018 41.7% 5.0% 10.0% 43.2%\n4Q 2017 41.7% 3.1% 7.9% 47.3%\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-L\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 6 A more risk-sensitive measure of credit exposure would consider the value of collateral held\nagainst counterparty exposures. Reporting banks held collateral valued at 126.2 percent of their\ntotal NCCE at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, down from 140.8 percent in the third quarter\nof 2024 (see table 7). Collateral held against hedge fund exposures decreased in the fourth\nquarter to 654.0 percent. Bank exposures to hedge funds are secured because banks take initial\nmargin on transactions with hedge funds, in addition to fully securing any current credit\nexposure. Collateral coverage of corporate and sovereign exposures is less than coverage of\nfinancial institutions and hedge funds.\nTable 7: Ratio of Fair Value (FV) Collateral to Net Current Credit Exposure\nFV corporate\nFV banks and FV sovereign and all other\nQuarter securities firms FV hedge funds governments counterparties FV\/NCCE %\n4Q 2024 131.1% 654.0% 80.7% 105.7% 126.2%\n3Q 2024 146.7% 754.7% 87.5% 116.8% 140.8%\n2Q 2024 134.3% 884.6% 87.3% 106.8% 129.0%\n1Q 2024 137.1% 892.0% 87.1% 104.8% 127.8%\n4Q 2023 141.8% 574.3% 79.1% 90.8% 118.8%\n4Q 2022 115.2% 477.1% 61.7% 83.3% 102.5%\n4Q 2021 129.8% 692.2% 69.3% 76.3% 108.7%\n4Q 2020 110.6% 467.6% 52.1% 59.5% 87.8%\n4Q 2019 130.0% 485.9% 48.3% 91.8% 114.5%\n4Q 2018 128.9% 308.0% 47.1% 91.8% 113.7%\n4Q 2017 124.4% 495.5% 25.1% 89.8% 111.5%\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-L\nMost of the collateral held by banks against NCCE is very liquid with 59.8 percent held in cash\n(both U.S. dollar and other currencies) and an additional 10.8 percent held in U.S. Treasuries and\nU.S. government agency securities (see table 8).

Banks use value-at-risk (VaR) to quantify the maximum expected loss over a specified\ntime and at a certain confidence level under relevant market conditions. Banks subject to the\nmarket risk capital rule, 12 CFR 3, subpart F, are required to report their VaR-based measures\nquarterly on Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Form 102. The VaR\nmeasurement is calculated daily using a one-tail, 99 percent confidence level and a holding\nperiod equivalent to a 10-business-day movement in underlying risk factors, such as rates,\nspreads, and prices. Tables 9a and 9b show the quarter-over-quarter change in VaR, as well as\nthe VaR-based capital charge, for banks most active in trading and derivatives activity. As shown\nin table 9a, market risk in trading operations, as measured by VaR, is a small proportion of their\nrisk-based capital. Figure 21 in the appendix illustrates the historical trend in VaR measurements\nfor these institutions.\nTable 9a: Value-at-Risk, in Millions of Dollars\nJPMorgan Goldman\nChase Bank Bank of Sachs Bank\nValue-at-risk NA Citibank NA America NA USA\n4Q 2024 average 60-day VaR $246 $189 $78 $333\n3Q 2024 average 60-day VaR $224 $162 $76 $272\nQ\/Q change $22 $27 $2 $61\n4Q 2024 total risk-based capital $296,041 $165,581 $209,256 $66,231\nSource: Market Risk Regulatory Report for Institutions Subject to the Market Risk Capital Rule\u2014FFIEC 102\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 8 Table 9b: Value-at-Risk Capital Requirement, in Millions of Dollars\nJPMorgan Goldman\nChase Bank Bank of Sachs Bank\nValue-at-risk capital requirement NA Citibank NA America NA USA\n4Q 2024 VaR capital requirement $738 $566 $234 $1,000\n3Q 2024 VaR capital requirement $673 $485 $228 $817\nQ\/Q change $65 $81 $6 $184\n4Q 2024 total risk-based capital $296,041 $165,581 $209,256 $66,231\nSource: Market Risk Regulatory Report for Institutions Subject to the Market Risk Capital Rule\u2014FFIEC 102\nVolatility Index\nFigure 3 shows the VIX, a volatility index,4 which measures the market\u2019s expectation of stock\nmarket volatility in the S&P 500 index over the next 30-day period. Higher volatility as\nrepresented by the VIX is associated with increased equity trading volume, which drives\nincreased bank and holding company equity trading revenue. The figure shows that an extended\nperiod of low volatility following the end of the 2008 financial crisis continued until late in the\nfirst quarter of 2020. In mid-March 2020, volatility spiked and exceeded its previous high from\nthe 2008 financial crisis as financial markets reacted to fears over the potential impact of the\nCOVID-19 global pandemic. While the volatility index experienced its largest one-day spike on\nAugust 25, 2024, because of an asymmetric widening of bid-ask spreads and corresponding\nincrease in option price quotes, the VIX has settled back to a more normal level of 17.4 percent\nat the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.\nFigure 3: Volatility Index (VIX)\nSource: Bloomberg\n4 VIX is the trademarked ticker symbol for the Chicago Board Options Exchange SPX Volatility Index.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 9 Level 3 Trading Assets\nAnother measure used to assess market risk is the volume of and changes in level 3 trading\nassets. Level 3 trading assets are assets whose fair value cannot be determined by using\nobservable inputs, such as market prices. Since the peak of the financial crisis at the end of 2008,\nmajor dealers have reduced the volume of level 3 trading assets. Because the model inputs that\ndetermine the fair value of these exposures are not derived from observable market transactions,\nbanks use their own model assumptions in determining their fair values. Level 3 trading assets\npeaked at $204.0 billion at the end of 2008 (see figure 4). At the end of the fourth quarter of\n2024, banks held $34 billion of level 3 trading assets, down 7.6 percent from the previous quarter\nand 3.6 percent lower than a year ago. Level 3 trading assets are $170 billion (83.3 percent)\nlower than the peak level from 2008.\nFigure 4: Level 3 Trading Assets, in Billions of Dollars\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-Q\nNotional Amounts of All Derivative Contracts\nChanges in notional amounts are generally reasonable reflections of business activity and can\nprovide insight into potential revenue and operational issues. The notional amount of derivative\ncontracts, however, does not provide a useful measure of market or credit risk.\nThe total notional amount of derivative contracts that banks held in the fourth quarter decreased\nby $32.2 trillion (14.7 percent) to $186.5 trillion from the previous quarter (see table 10). The\ndecrease in the notional amount of derivative contracts by underlying risk exposure was driven\nby decreases across all instruments. Interest rate notional amounts continued to represent the\nmajority of banks\u2019 derivative holdings at $125.5 trillion, or 67.5 percent of total derivatives (see\ntable 10).\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 10 Table 10: Derivative Notional Amounts by Underlying Risk Exposure Quarter-Over-Quarter, in Billions of\nDollars\nQ\/Q Q\/Q % Y\/Y Y\/Y %\nTrading instrument 4Q 2024 3Q 2024 Change Change 4Q 2023 Change Change\nInterest rate $125,925 $150,366 -$24,441 -16.3% $136,274 -$10,350 -7.6%\nFX $48,327 $55,012 -$6,685 -12.2% $45,278 $3,050 6.7%\nEquity $6,443 $6,801 -$359 -5.3% $5,674 $769 13.6%\nCommodity and other $1,677 $1,808 -$130 -7.2% $1,493 $185 12.4%\nCredit derivatives $4,134 $4,752 -$618 -13.0% $3,746 $388 10.4%\nTotal notional $186,505 $218,739 -$32,234 -14.7% $192,464 -$5,959 -3.1%\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-L\nThe decrease in the total notional amount of derivative contracts by contract type was primarily\ndriven by decreases in swap contracts and futures and forwards (see table 11).

In\nthe fourth quarter of 2024, 32.5 percent of banks\u2019 derivative holdings were centrally cleared (see\ntable 12). From a market factor perspective, 44.3 percent of interest rate derivative contracts\u2019\nnotional amounts outstanding were centrally cleared, while very little of the FX derivative\nmarket was centrally cleared. The bank-held credit derivative market remained largely uncleared,\nas 26.5 percent of credit derivative transactions were centrally cleared during the fourth quarter\nof 2024.\nCentrally cleared derivative transactions were heavily concentrated at qualifying central\ncounterparties, with 79.2 percent of notional amounts reflecting the 2 percent risk weight\napplicable to such counterparties.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 12 Table 12: Centrally Cleared Derivative Contracts as a Percentage of Total Derivative Contracts\nInterest Precious\nQuarter rate FX Equity metals Credit Other Total\n4Q 2024 44.3% 3.5% 20.8% 10.2% 26.5% 12.9% 32.5%\n3Q 2024 47.3% 3.2% 23.8% 7.7% 31.2% 14.3% 35.2%\n2Q 2024 48.6% 3.1% 23.5% 6.4% 27.0% 13.4% 36.3%\n1Q 2024 47.9% 3.0% 25.2% 6.9% 29.6% 13.2% 35.9%\n4Q 2023 44.9% 2.9% 24.0% 6.7% 28.2% 12.9% 33.9%\n3Q 2023 49.7% 3.1% 23.4% 6.8% 32.5% 14.0% 37.8%\n2Q 2023 52.9% 3.0% 23.5% 7.7% 35.1% 12.5% 41.3%\n1Q 2023 52.2% 3.0% 24.7% 7.3% 30.9% 12.6% 40.5%\n4Q 2022 49.1% 2.7% 23.8% 8.8% 28.9% 12.2% 37.9%\n3Q 2022 54.3% 3.0% 23.9% 6.6% 30.6% 12.9% 41.7%\n2Q 2022 55.9% 3.2% 24.8% 5.9% 25.4% 12.3% 43.1%\n1Q 2022 56.1% 2.9% 24.3% 6.4% 33.8% 12.4% 43.4%\n4Q 2021 51.8% 2.0% 20.6% 3.1% 29.2% 12.3% 39.4%\nSource: Call reports, Schedule RC-R\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 13 Glossary of Terms\nBilateral netting: A legally enforceable arrangement between a bank and a counterparty that\ncreates a single legal obligation covering all included individual contracts. This arrangement\nmeans that a bank\u2019s receivables or payables, in the event of the default or insolvency of one of\nthe parties, would be the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of contracts included in\nthe bilateral netting arrangement.\nCentrally cleared derivative contract: A standardized derivative contract that is transacted\nbilaterally but submitted for clearing to a central counterparty, with the central counterparty\nbecoming the ultimate counterparty to both the buyer and the seller.\nCredit derivative: A financial contract that allows a party to take on or reduce credit exposure\n(generally on a bond, loan, or index). The OCC\u2019s derivatives survey includes OTC credit\nderivatives, such as credit default swaps, total return swaps, and credit spread options.\nDerivative: A financial contract in which the value is derived from the performance of\nunderlying market factors, such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity,\ncredit, and equity prices. Derivative transactions include a wide assortment of financial contracts,\nsuch as structured debt obligations and deposits, swaps, futures, options, caps, floors, collars,\nforwards, and various combinations thereof.\nGross negative fair value (GNFV): The sum total of the fair values of contracts when the bank\nowes money to its counterparties, without taking netting into account. This amount represents the\nmaximum losses the bank\u2019s counterparties would incur if the bank defaulted and there was no\nnetting of contracts, and the counterparties held no bank collateral. GNFVs associated with credit\nderivatives are included.\nGross positive fair value (GPFV): The sum total of the fair values of contracts when the bank\nis owed money by its counterparties, without taking netting into account. This amount represents\nthe maximum losses a bank would incur if all its counterparties defaulted and there was no\nnetting of contracts, and the bank held no counterparty collateral. GPFVs associated with credit\nderivatives are included.\nNet current credit exposure (NCCE): For a portfolio of derivative contracts, NCCE is the\nGPFV of contracts less the dollar amount of netting benefits. On any individual contract, current\ncredit exposure (CCE) is the fair value of the contract if positive and zero when the fair value is\nnegative or zero. NCCE is also the net amount owed to banks if all contracts were immediately\nliquidated.\nNotional amount: The nominal or face amount that is used to calculate payments made on\nswaps and other risk management products. This amount generally does not change hands and is\nthus referred to as notional.\nOTC derivative contracts: Privately negotiated derivative contracts that are transacted off\norganized exchanges.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 14 Potential future exposure (PFE): An estimate of what the CCE could be over time, based on a\nsupervisory formula in the agencies\u2019 risk-based capital rules. PFE is generally determined by\nmultiplying the notional amount of the contract by a credit conversion factor that is based on the\nunderlying market factor (e.g., interest rates, commodity prices, or equity prices) and the\ncontract\u2019s remaining maturity. The risk-based capital rules, however, permit banks to adjust the\nformulaic PFE measure by the net-to-gross ratio, which proxies the risk-reduction benefits\nattributable to a valid bilateral netting contract. PFE data in this report use the amounts on which\nbanks hold risk-based capital.\nQualifying central counterparties (QCCP): QCCPs are defined in 12 CFR 3.2 as a CCP either\nthat the Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated systemically important under title\nVIII of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or that meets a series\nof standards. See 12 CFR 3.2 for a full definition.\nTotal credit exposure: The sum total of NCCE and PFE.\nTotal risk-based capital: The sum of tier 1 plus tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital generally consists\nof common shareholders\u2019 equity, perpetual preferred shareholders\u2019 equity with noncumulative\ndividends, retained earnings, and tier 1 capital of consolidated subsidiaries that is not owned by\nthe bank (minority interest), less regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 2 capital generally\nconsists of subordinated debt, intermediate-term preferred stock, cumulative and long-term\npreferred stock, tier 2 capital of consolidated subsidiaries that is not owned by the bank (minority\ninterest), and a portion of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses less regulatory\nadjustments and deductions.\nVolatility index (VIX): A measure of the market\u2019s expectation of stock market volatility of\nS&P 500 index options over the next 30-day period.\nQuarterly Derivatives Report: Fourth Quarter 2024 15 Appendix: Index of Tables and Figures\nTables\nTable 1: Quarterly Bank Trading Revenue, in Millions of Dollars .................................................2\nTable 2: Quarterly Holding Company Trading Revenue, in Millions of Dollars ............................2\nTable 3a: Gross Positive Fair Values, in Billions of Dollars ...........................................................4\nTable 3b: Gross Negative Fair Values, in Billions of Dollars .........................................................4\nTable 4: Netting Contract Examples ................................................................................................5\nTable 5: Net Current Credit Exposure, in Billions of Dollars .........................................................5\nTable 6: Net Current Credit Exposure by Counterparty Type as a Percentage of\nTotal Net Current Credit Exposure ............................................................................................6\nTable 7: Ratio of Fair Value Collateral to Net Current Credit Exposure ........................................7\nTable 8: Composition of Collateral..................................................................................................8\nTable 9a: Value-at-Risk, in Millions of Dollars ..............................................................................8\nTable 9b: Value-at-Risk Capital Requirement, in Millions of Dollars ............................................9\nTable 10: Derivative Notional Amounts by Underlying Risk Exposure\nQuarter-Over-Quarter, in Billions of Dollars ...........................................................................11\nTable 11: Derivative Notional Amounts by Contract Type\nQuarter-Over-Quarter, in Billions of Dollars ...........................................................................11\nTable 12: Centrally Cleared Derivative Contracts as a Percentage of\nTotal Derivative Contracts .......................................................................................................13\nTable 13.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-21 | March 20, 2025 OCC Ceases Examinations for Reputation Risk Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced that it will no longer examine its regulated institutions for reputation risk and is removing references to reputation risk from its Comptroller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Handbook booklets and guidance issuances. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions support the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission and its supervisory objectives to ensure that banks have appropriate and strong risk management processes for their business activities, treat customers fairly, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examination process has always been rooted in ensuring appropriate risk management processes for bank activities, not casting judgment on how a particular activity may fare with public opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe OCC has never used reputation risk as a catch-all justification for supervisory action. Focusing future examination activities on more transparent risk areas improves public confidence in the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supervisory process and makes clear that the OCC has not and does not make business decisions for banks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The removal of references to reputation risk from OCC handbooks and guidance issuances does not alter the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectation that banks remain diligent and adhere to prudent risk management practices across all other risk areas. The OCC expects to complete its efforts to update its public documents in the coming weeks.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-20 | March 20, 2025 OCC Announces Enforcement Actions for March 2025 Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises. The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are: Cease and Desist Order against 42 North Private Bank, Canton, Massachusetts, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to interest rate risk, strategic planning, capital, liquidity, and earnings. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-110). The OCC also terminated the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cease and desist order dated March 30, 2017, which was replaced by the cease and desist order. (Docket No. AA-EC-2016-93) The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are: Order of Prohibition against Karla Vanderneut, former Assistant Branch Manager at an Earlville, New York, branch of NBT Bank, National Association, Norwich, New York, for using a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account to make unauthorized cash withdrawals and debit card transactions totaling at least $16,000. (Docket No. AA-NE-2024-105) Order of Prohibition against Josiah Kennedy, former Vice President and Mortgage Loan Officer at Citizens Bank, N.A., Abilene, Texas, for making unauthorized draws on a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s construction loan and obtaining customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funds, totaling at least $59,000, for his personal benefit. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-01) The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d into a new action. Termination actions include: Order terminating the Cease and Desist Order against ICICI Bank Limited, New York, New York, dated October 3, 2022 (Docket No. AA-ENF-2022-56). The order addressed violations of law and regulation related to the branch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bank Secrecy Act\/Anti-Money Laundering compliance program. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-15) Order terminating the Cease and Desist Order against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, dated September 9, 2021 (Docket No. AA-ENF-2021-29). The order addressed significant deficiencies related to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss mitigation activities.

Upon acquisition, CenTrust Bank, N.A. was renamed SmartBiz Bank, N.A. CenTrust further applied to change its business model to conduct small business lending activities on a nationwide basis. The OCC granted a change to the business model after thorough review of SmartBiz and its current operations. In granting this application, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards applied to all new entrants to the federal banking system. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA safe, sound and fair fintech business model has a place in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s federal banking system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis conditional approval demonstrates the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to a regulatory framework that supports innovations in banking that expand access to financial services for consumers and communities across the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The federal banking system includes more than 1,000 national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the United States that range in size from community banks under $10 billion in assets focused on meeting local needs to the largest internationally active banks. These banking companies conduct a wide array of businesses that range from retail and wholesale banking activity to trust, credit card and other more narrowly focused services. The institutions that make up the federal banking system conduct approximately 66 percent of the banking activity in the United States, hold more than $16 trillion in assets combined, and manage more than $67 trillion under their custody and fiduciary control.

Buccino\nChief Executive Officer\nCenTrust Bank, National Association\n385 Waukegan Road\nNorthbrook, IL 60062\nRe: Substantial Asset Change Application and Residency Waivers\nCenTrust Bank, National Association, Northbrook, Illinois\nCharter Number: 24617\nOCC Control Numbers: 2023-5.53-334213 and 2024-Waiver-337608\nDear Mr. Buccino:\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) hereby conditionally approves the\napplication of CenTrust Bank, National Association, Northbrook, Illinois (CenTrust), to effect a\nsubstantial asset change resulting from a material increase in size. The application is part of a\nlarger transaction in which Billfloat, Inc., a Delaware corporation doing business as SmartBiz\nLoans (SmartBiz), seeks to become a bank holding company by indirectly acquiring CenTrust.\nThis conditional approval is granted after a thorough review of all available information,\nincluding the representations and commitments made in the application and by CenTrust\u2019s and\nSmartBiz\u2019s representatives.\nCenTrust applied to the OCC for prior approval of a substantial asset change under 12 CFR 5.53.\nThe proposed transaction will occur in two steps: (i) first, SmartBiz has established a merger\nsubsidiary that will merge with and into United Community Bancshares, Inc. (UCB), a Delaware\ncorporation and CenTrust\u2019s bank holding company, with UCB remaining as the surviving entity;\nand (ii) second, SmartBiz will merge with and into UCB, with UCB surviving (collectively, the\nTransaction). The business plan indicates that SmartBiz will expand the national bank\u2019s lending\nand deposit-taking activites nationwide causing a material increase in assets, as well as offer a\nloan origination platform to partner banks. The business plan also provides that CenTrust Bank,\nNational Association will be renamed as SmartBiz Bank, National Association (collectively, the\nBank).\nIn deciding the change in asset composition application, the OCC considered the factors under\n12 CFR 5.53(d)(3) including the capital level of the resulting institution; the conformity of the\ntransaction to applicable law, regulation and supervisory policies; the purpose of the transaction;\nthe transaction\u2019s impact on the safety and soundness of the bank; and any effect on the bank\u2019s\nshareholders, depositors, other creditors, and customers. The OCC also considered additional\nfactors under 12 CFR 5.20(f)(2) including whether the directors are familiar with national\nbanking laws and regulations; whether there is competent management, including a board of directors, with ability and experience relevant to the types of services to be provided; whether\ncapital is sufficient to support the projected volume and type of business; whether the institution\ncan reasonably be expected to achieve and maintain profitability; whether the institution will be\noperated in a safe and sound manner; and whether the title misrepresents the nature of the\ninstitution or the services it offers. The OCC reviewed all factors and deemed conditional\napproval consistent with regulatory requirements.\nAdditionally, the OCC hereby grants a waiver of the residency requirements of 12 USC 72 for\nthe non-resident directors listed in Attachment A for the Bank. These waivers are based upon a\nthorough review of all available information, including the representations and commitments\nmade in the application by CenTrust\u2019s and SmartBiz\u2019s representatives. The OCC reserves the\nright to withdraw the waivers at any time and, at our discretion, to request additional\nbiographical and\/or financial information on these individuals. All other requirements of 12 USC\n72 remain applicable.\nThis approval is subject to the following conditions:\n1. The Bank shall: (i) give the San Francisco Supervisory Office at least sixty (60) days\nprior written notice of its intent to significantly deviate or change from its business plan\nor operations,1 and (ii) obtain the OCC\u2019s written determination of no objection before the\nBank engages in any significant deviation or change from its business plan or operations.\nThe OCC may impose additional conditions it deems appropriate in a written\ndetermination of no objection to the Bank\u2019s notice. This condition shall remain in effect\nduring the Bank\u2019s first three years of operation.\n2. The Bank shall maintain loan concentrations consistent with all loan concentration limits\nset forth in its business plan.\n3.

After consummation of the Transaction, the Bank must file an Interagency Biographical\nand Financial Report with the OCC and receive a letter of no objection from the OCC\nprior to any new executive officer or director assuming such position. This condition\nshall remain in effect during the Bank\u2019s first two years of operation.\n1 If such deviation is the subject of an application filed with the OCC, no separate notice to the supervisory office is\nrequired.\n2 6. The Bank shall submit a draft Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Strategic Plan within\nninety (90) days of the closing of the Transaction and a finalized CRA Strategic Plan\nwithin twelve (12) months of the closing of the Transaction.\n7. The Bank shall take all steps necessary to ensure compliance with all representations and\ncommitments made by CenTrust, SmartBiz, and their representatives in the application,\nincluding those set forth in the letter dated February 5, 2025, from Gerard Buccino, Chief\nExecutive Officer, to the OCC, and to see that they are fully adopted, timely\nimplemented, and adhered to thereafter.\nThe conditions of this approval are conditions \u201cimposed in writing by a Federal banking agency\nin connection with any action on any application, notice, or other request\u201d within the meaning of\n12 USC 1818. As such, the conditions are enforceable under 12 USC 1818.\nThis approval is also subject to the following pre-consummation requirement:\n1.

If any of the terms, conditions, or parties to the Transaction described in the application\nchange, the OCC must be informed in writing prior to consummation to determine if any\nadditional action or reconsideration is required. In such situations, the OCC reserves the right to\nrequire submission of an amended or new Substantial Asset Change application.\nYou are reminded that in order to make the Bank\u2019s title change effective, the Bank shall submit\namended Articles of Association to the OCC pursuant to 12 USC 21a and 12 CFR 5.42.\nThis approval and the activities and communications by OCC employees in connection with the\nfiling do not constitute a contract, express or implied, or any other obligation binding upon the\nOCC, the United States, any agency or entity of the United States, or any officer or employee of\nthe United States, and do not affect the ability of the OCC to exercise its supervisory, regulatory\nand examination authorities under applicable law and regulations.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-17 | March 10, 2025 Agencies Issue 2024 Shared National Credit Program Report Share This Page: Joint Release Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Reserve Board Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Federal bank regulatory agencies today reported in the 2024 Shared National Credit (SNC) report that credit risk associated with large, syndicated bank loans remains moderate. However, the agencies noted weakened credit quality trends continue due to the pressure of higher interest rates on leveraged borrowers and compressed operating margins in some industry sectors. The agencies also noted that the magnitude and direction of risk in 2025 is likely to be impacted by borrowers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to manage interest expenses, real estate conditions, and other macroeconomic factors. The 2024 review reflects the examination of SNC loans originated on or before June 30, 2024. The review focused on leveraged loans and stressed borrowers from various industry sectors and assessed aggregate loan commitments of $100 million or more that are shared by multiple regulated financial institutions. The 2024 SNC portfolio included 6,699 borrowers totaling $6.5 trillion in commitments, an increase in commitments of 1.8 percent from a year ago. The percentage of loans that deserve management's close attention (\u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-pass\u00e2\u0080\u009d loans comprised of SNC commitments rated \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial mention\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cclassified\u00e2\u0080\u009d) increased from 8.9 percent of total commitments to 9.1 percent year over year. While U.S. banks hold 45 percent of all SNC commitments, they hold only 23 percent of non-pass loans. Nearly half of total SNC commitments are leveraged, and leveraged loans comprise 79 percent of non-pass loans.

The\nSNC Program is governed by an interagency agreement among the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (the agencies). The program began in 1977 to review borrowers with\nminimum aggregate loan commitments totaling $20 million or more that were shared by two or\nmore regulated financial institutions (banks). A program modification in 1998 increased the\nminimum number of regulated financial institutions from two to three. To adjust for inflation and\nchanges in average loan size, the agencies increased the minimum aggregate loan commitment\nthreshold from $20 million to $100 million effective January 1, 2018.\nSNC reviews are completed in the first and third quarters of the calendar year. Large agent banks\nreceive two reviews each year while other agent banks are reviewed less frequently. The results\ndiscussed in this document reflect reviews conducted in the first and third quarters of 2024, and\nprimarily cover loan commitments originated on or before June 30, 2024.\nTrends and exhibits shown in the report include outstanding loans and commitments by all\nreporting banks. Although some banks are reviewed twice a year, the agencies issue a single\nstatement annually that captures combined findings from the previous 12 months. The next\nstatement will be released upon completion of the third quarter 2025 SNC review.\nSummary of Results\nOverall, SNC credit risk remains moderate. There was a modest increase in the severity of risk due\nto a migration of commitments from special mention to a classified rating. The trend reflects the\ncontinued pressure of higher interest rates, which have increased significantly since early 2022,\nand the impact of compressed operating margins in some industry sectors. Commitments rated\nspecial mention and classified (non-pass) have increased slightly from 8.9 percent of total\ncommitments in 2023 to 9.1 percent in 2024. U.S. and foreign banks continue to own the largest\nshare of SNC commitments, while nonbanks hold the largest share of special mention and\nclassified loans. Nonbank holdings are concentrated in non-investment grade1 term loans identified\nand reported as leveraged by agent banks.\nThe agencies continue to select SNC transactions to review using a risk-based sampling\napproach, which in 2024 focused on bank-identified leveraged loans, special mention and\nclassified loans, and loans to borrowers in stressed industry segments (2024 Focus Industries as\ndefined on page 6). Asset quality measures and trends in the composition of SNC commitments by\nmajor industry group2 are provided in Appendix C.\nThe modestly higher rate of special mention and classified commitments in 2024 is driven by\nweakened credit quality in Technology, Telecom, and Media; Commercial Services; Health Care\nand Pharmaceutical; and Materials and Commodities excluding Oil and Gas industry segments.\nTechnology, Telecom and Media comprise one-third of the total special mention and classified\ncommitments. While the overall level of special mention and classified commitments in the\nCommercial Real Estate sector remains slightly below the portfolio average, the office sub-sector\ncontinues to show a decline in credit quality with above portfolio average special mention and\nclassified volumes.\n1 In this document, the terms \"non-investment grade\" and \"investment grade\" are based on bank-provided facility-level equivalent ratings.\n2 The agencies introduced industry data in 2008 that presented industries vertically along product origination and distribution lines. The\nreview places borrowers in seven primary sectors, largely following the outline of the 2017 U.S. Census Bureau North American\nIndustry Classification System codes (see appendix C).\n- 2 - The magnitude and direction of risk in 2025 is likely to be impacted by borrowers\u2019 ability to manage\ninterest expense, real estate conditions, and other macroeconomic factors. These elements will\ncontinue to impact the financial performance and repayment capacity of borrowers in a wide\nvariety of industries, especially highly leveraged borrowers that may lack the financial flexibility to\nrespond to external challenges.\nLeveraged Loans\nCredit risk associated with leveraged lending remains high. While leveraged loans comprise nearly\nhalf of total SNC commitments, they represent a disproportionately high percent of the total special\nmention and classified exposures. SNC reviews continue to note that many leveraged loans\ncontain weak structures. These structures often reflect layered risks that include some combination\nof high leverage levels, aggressive repayment assumptions, and other underwriting weaknesses.\nBusiness models that focus on distribution of widely syndicated institutional term loans to\nnonbanks tend to produce higher levels of marginal structures. Investor demand for loans has\nenabled borrowers to obtain less restrictive terms, which continues to result in a high volume of\nlayered risk. To date, the performance of these leveraged loans has not been tested through a\ntypical economic cycle. The agencies continue to focus on assessing the impact of layered risks in\nleveraged lending transactions and the appropriateness of credit risk management practices in\nadapting to the changing environment.\nBanks appropriately manage leveraged lending exposure by employing risk management practices\nthat adhere to regulatory safety and soundness standards and adapt to changing economic\nconditions.\nNonbank entities continue to participate in the leveraged lending market to earn returns by holding\npurchased credit exposure. These nonbank entities hold a significant portion of non-pass\nleveraged commitments and non-investment grade3 equivalent leveraged term loans. By\ncomparison, the SNC leveraged exposure held at banks is primarily comprised of investment\ngrade equivalent revolving credit facilities. However, the agencies note that these investment\npreferences are not universal as risk appetite varies among bank and nonbank participants.\nSNC Commitments: Volume, Credit Quality, and Trends\nOverall SNC Population\nThe 2024 SNC commitments totaled $6.5 trillion. Total commitments showed a modest increase of\n$113 billion, or 1.8 percent year-over-year, with an increase of $98 billion in loans reported as\ninvestment grade by agent banks. Outstanding balances remained virtually unchanged with an\nincrease of 0.2 percent over the same timeframe. Additionally, the number of borrowers and credit\nfacilities increased by 1.7 and 1.3 percent, respectively in 2024 (see exhibits 1 and 2).\n3 In this document, the terms \"non-investment grade\" and \"investment grade\" are based on bank-provided facility-level equivalent ratings.\n- 3 - Exhibit 1: Overall Credit Facilities and Commitment Trends\nTotal Unfunded Total Outstanding Total Number of Facilities (Line)\nNote: The decline in the number of SNC credit facilities between 2017 and 2018 mainly reflects the minimum commitment increase from\n$20 million to $100 million.\nExhibit 2 details the year-over-year changes in aggregate SNC commitment amounts and reflects\na modest increase in total special mention and classified commitments and a migration in the level\nof special mention (referred to as \u201cSM\u201d in the table below) to classified SNC commitments. In\naddition, the volume of nonaccrual commitments increased by 29.1 percent, driven by\ncommitments within the Technology, Telecom and Media industry.\nExhibit 2: SNC Summary Statistics\n2023 Commitments 2024 Commitments 2024 vs. 2023\n2024 vs. 2023 (%)\n($Billions) ($Billions) ($Billions)\nTotal Commitments $6,408.8 $6,521.9 113.1 1.8%\nTotal Outstanding $3,144.9 $3,151.4 6.5 0.2%\nTotal Borrowers (#) 6,589 6,699 110 1.7%\nTotal Facilities (#) 11,042 11,188 146 1.3%\nSM and Classified Commitments $572.2 $595.8 23.6 4.1%\nSM Commitments $176.6 $161.8 (14.8) -8.4%\nClassified Commitments $395.6 $434.0 38.4 9.7%\nNonaccrual Commitments $50.4 $65.1 14.7 29.1%\nNote: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.\n- 4 - Exhibit 3 shows trends in the dollar volume of special mention plus classified commitments as a\npercentage of total commitments. The dollar volume and percentage of special mention plus\nclassified commitments increased modestly in 2024. Special mention plus classified commitments\nnow represent 9.1 percent of total commitments, with a classified rate of 6.6 percent and a special\nmention rate of 2.5 percent. Total classified commitments increased $38.4 billion from 2023, while\nspecial mention decreased by $14.8 billion over the same time frame.\nExhibit 3: Overall Special Mention Plus Classified Volume and Percentage Trends\nLeveraged Lending\nAgent bank-identified leveraged loans represent 45 percent of total SNC commitments, 79 percent\nof special mention commitments, and 84 percent of classified commitments. Total agent bank-\nidentified leveraged loan commitments grew modestly by $10.5 billion between 2023 and 2024.\nNewly originated agent bank-identified leveraged lending remains a primary focus of SNC review\nsamples given the volume, asset quality, and layered underwriting risk within the segment. The\n2024 SNC sample covered 34 percent of agent bank-identified leveraged lending commitments\nand 28 percent of agent bank-identified leveraged borrowers (see exhibit 4).\nExhibit 4: SNC Leveraged Lending Exposure and Review Sample\n2023 SNC 2024 SNC\n2024 vs. 2023\nReview Review\n($Billions)\n($Billions) ($Billions)\nSNC Leveraged Lending Commitments $2,953.0 $2,963.5 $10.5\nSampled SNC Leveraged Lending Commitments $1,032.0 $996.3 ($35.7)\nSNC Leveraged Lending Borrowers (#) 2,508 2,481 -27\nSampled SNC Leveraged Lending Borrowers (#) 692 696 4\nNote: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.\n- 5 - Banks hold $1.9 trillion or 63 percent of agent bank-identified leveraged term loans and revolvers,\nmost of which consists of higher rated and investment grade equivalent revolvers. Nonbanks\nprimarily hold non-investment grade equivalent term loans (see exhibit 5).\nExhibit 5: Agent Bank Identified Leveraged Lending by Ownership, Credit Type and Quality\n2024 SNC 2024 SNC\nAgent Bank-Identified Leveraged Lending Bank Owned Nonbank Owned\n($Billions) ($Billions)\nInvestment Grade - Revolver $862.6 $19.1\nInvestment Grade - Term Loan $186.3 $38.4\nNon-Investment Grade - Revolver $561.9 $27.0\nNon-Investment Grade - Term Loan $242.6 $994.3\nTotal $1,853.4 $1,078.8\nNote: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.\n2024 Focus Industries\nThe agencies focused on the Commercial Services; Health Care and Pharmaceuticals; Materials\nand Commodities; Real Estate and Construction; and Technology, Telecom and Media industry\nsegments in 2024. These industries showed high and\/or increasing special mention and classified\nrates. The agencies targeted sub-groups within these industries that had greater vulnerability to\nidiosyncratic and other macroeconomic factors.\nExhibit 6 illustrates trends in the level of special mention and classified as a percentage of total\ncommitments within the five focused industry segments. Technology, Telecom, and Media remains\nthe highest special mention and classified rate at 19.7 percent, followed by Commercial Services\nat 17.4 percent, Health Care and Pharmaceuticals at 14.4 percent, and Materials and Commodities\nexcluding Oil and Gas industry segments at 12.4 percent. As reflected in Exhibit 7, risk in\nCommercial Real Estate varies by sub-sector, with special mention and classified commitments\nincreasing in Office, Hotel and Lodging, and multi-family and healthcare within the All Other\ncategory and a decrease in Retail. Exhibit 7 illustrates that banks own a higher percentage of non-\npass commitments, while the current non-pass rate for Commercial Real Estate has increased to\n8.2 percent as reflected in Exhibit 6.\n- 6 - Exhibit 6: Risk Composition and Trends within 2024 Focus Industries\nExhibit 7: Special Mention and Classified Trends within Commercial Real Estate\n- 7 - SNC Commitments: Ownership of Risk\nU.S. Banks continue to hold the largest amount of SNC commitments, followed by Foreign Banking\nOrganizations (FBOs) and Nonbanks (see exhibit 8). Nonbanks continue to hold a disproportionate\nshare of all loan commitments rated special mention and classified (see exhibit 9); however, the\nlevel held by banks increased during 2024. U.S. Banks and FBOs held 79.7 percent of the total\nexposure, which is relatively unchanged from 2023. During the same time frame, U.S. Banks\u2019 and\nFBOs\u2019 percent of the non-pass exposure increased from 35.0 to 40.4 percent. The special mention\nand classified rates at U.S. Banks and FBOs are 4.7 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, while\nthe special mention and classified rate at Nonbanks is 26.8 percent.\nExhibit 8: Distribution of SNC Commitments by Lender Type\n2022 2023 2024 2022 2023 2024\nLender\nCommitments Commitments Commitments Commitments Commitments Commitments\nType\n($Billions) ($Billions) ($Billions) % % %\nU.S. Banks $2,638.0 $2,954.0 $2,986.9 44.7% 46.1% 45.8%\nFBOs $1,906.9 $2,102.2 $2,209.8 32.3% 32.8% 33.9%\nNonbanks $1,352.2 $1,352.5 $1,325.1 22.9% 21.1% 20.3%\nTotal $5,897.1 $6,408.8 $6,521.9 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nNote: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.\nExhibit 9: Distribution of SNC Special Mention and Classified Commitments by Lender Type\n2024 Special Mention 2 0 2 4 S pecial Mention 2 024 Special Mention\nLender Type and Classified and Classified and Classified\n($Billions by owner) (% by owner) (% of total Committed by owner)\nU.S. Banks $139.4 23.4% 4.7%\nFBOs $101.3 17.0% 4.6%\nNonbanks $355.1 59.6% 26.8%\nTotal $595.8 100.0% 9.1%\nNote: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.\nDetails on supervisory definitions, outstanding balances, industry trends, and exposure by entity\ntype can be found in the appendices of this document.\n- 8 - Appendix A: Definitions\nAgent Bank: Agent Bank is defined as a federally supervised institution that originates or\nadministers a SNC for the syndication or participating lenders.\nClassified Commitments: Classified commitments include commitments rated substandard,\ndoubtful, and loss as defined below.\nCredit Facilities: Credit facilities include syndicated loans and loan commitments, letters of\ncredit, commercial leases, and other forms of credit. Commitment amounts include both drawn\nand undrawn portions of the loans or credit facilities. The SNC review reports only the par\namounts of commitments, which may differ from the amounts at which loans are carried by\ninvestors.\nDoubtful: Doubtful commitments have all the weaknesses of commitments classified\nsubstandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in\nfull, on the basis of available current information, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoss: Commitments classified as loss are uncollectible and of so little value that their\ncontinuance as bankable commitments is not warranted. Amounts classified as loss should be\npromptly charged off. This classification does not mean that there is no recovery or salvage\nvalue, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off these commitments, even\nthough some value may be recovered in the future.\nNonaccrual: Nonaccrual loans are defined for regulatory reporting purposes as loans and lease\nfinancing receivables that are required to be reported on a nonaccrual basis because (a) they are\nmaintained on a cash basis owing to a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower, (b)\npayment in full of interest or principal is not expected, or (c) principal or interest has been in default\nfor 90 days or longer, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection.\nNon-pass: A non-pass loan is any loan rated special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss.\nPass: A credit facility that is in good standing and is not rated special mention or classified in any\nway.\nShared National Credit (SNC): A SNC is any loan or formal commitment, and any asset such as\nreal estate, stocks, notes, bonds, and debentures taken as debts previously contracted, extended\nto borrowers by a federally supervised institution, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, that aggregates\nto $100 million or more and is shared by three or more unaffiliated federally supervised\ninstitutions, or a portion of which is sold to two or more such institutions.\nSpecial Mention (SM): Special mention commitments have potential weaknesses that deserve\nmanagement's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses could result in\nfurther deterioration of the repayment prospects or in the institution's credit position in the future.\nSpecial mention commitments are not adversely classified and do not expose institutions to\nsufficient risk to warrant adverse rating.\nSubstandard: Substandard commitments are inadequately protected by the current sound worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-16 | March 7, 2025 OCC Clarifies Bank Authority to Engage in Certain Cryptocurrency Activities Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today took action to reaffirm that a range of cryptocurrency activities are permissible in the federal banking system. The OCC published Interpretive Letter 1183 to confirm that crypto-asset custody, certain stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as distributed ledger are permissible for national banks and federal savings associations. The letter also rescinds the requirement for OCC-supervised institutions to receive supervisory nonobjection and demonstrate that they have adequate controls in place before they can engage in these cryptocurrency activities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action will reduce the burden on banks to engage in crypto-related activities and ensure that these bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology. I will continue to work diligently to ensure regulations are effective and not excessive, while maintaining a strong federal banking system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Consistent with Interpretive Letter 1183, the OCC also withdrew its participation in the joint statement on crypto-asset risks to banking organizations and the joint statement on liquidity risks to banking organizations resulting from crypto-asset market vulnerabilities.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-12 | February 20, 2025 OCC Announces Enforcement Actions for February 2025 Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises. The OCC also announced updates to its enforcement action search tool. The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are: Formal Agreement with Dearborn FSB, Dearborn, Michigan, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to compliance management, fair lending risk management, insider activities, and compensation practices; and violations related to recordkeeping. (Docket No. AA-CE-2025-2) Formal Agreement with Patriot Bank, N.A., Stamford, Connecticut, for violations and unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning, capital planning, Bank Secrecy Act\/Anti-Money Laundering risk management, payment activities oversight, credit administration, and concentration risk management. (Docket No. AA-NE-2025-05) The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are: Order of Prohibition against Max M. Bender, former Operations Processor at a Cincinnati, Ohio, location of U.S. Bank, N.A., Cincinnati, Ohio, for misappropriating funds from commercial customer deposits, resulting in a loss of at least $23,000 to the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-99) Order of Prohibition against Justin Cooper, former Bank Teller at a Ramsey, New Jersey, branch of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for accessing customer records without authorization and providing customer information to a third party in exchange for money. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-87) Order of Prohibition against Larry DeWitt, former Chief Credit Officer and Lending Officer at BancCentral, N.A., Alva, Oklahoma, for, among other things, failing to secure cash collateral required for certain new market tax credit loans, which caused the bank to violate its legal lending limit, and failing to inform the bank of a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impending withdrawal of millions of dollars on deposit with the bank, which he encouraged, facilitated, and understood could severely impact the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liquidity. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-101) Order of Prohibition against Jackeline Graves, former Retail Banker at a Port Arthur, Texas, branch of Woodforest National Bank, The Woodlands, Texas, for gaining unauthorized access to bank customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 personal information and forging their names onto checks to steal at least $14,000. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-06) Order of Prohibition against Derek Heaton, former Chief Lending Officer at BancCentral, N.A., Alva, Oklahoma, for failing to secure cash collateral required for certain new market tax credit loans, which caused the bank to violate its legal lending limit. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-102) Order of Prohibition and to Cease and Desist against Mark Tillman, former Loan Officer at Citizens Bank, N.A., Providence, Rhode Island, for, among other things, making false statements and statements of omission to influence the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mortgage lending decisions; failing to review, identify, and escalate red flags in mortgage loan applications or supporting information; and failing to fully disclose the involvement of a mortgage broker and the broker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fees. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-111) The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d into a new action. Termination actions include: Order Terminating the Cease and Desist Order against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, dated April 20, 2018 (Docket No. AA-EC-2018-15). The order addressed unsafe or unsound practices in the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enterprise-wide compliance risk management program and violations of law that resulted in consumer harm. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-13) The OCC also updated its enforcement actions search tool to allow users to search for enforcement actions issued since 2012 by subject matter and to easily view subject matters covered in those actions. This update provides additional transparency into and search capability for the contents of the public enforcement action database. All OCC public enforcement actions taken since August 1989 are available for download by viewing the enforcement actions database at https:\/\/apps.occ.gov\/EASearch.

The supervisory scenarios include baseline and severely adverse scenarios. Covered institutions are required to use the scenarios to conduct stress tests.

Section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, requires certain financial companies, including certain national banks and federal savings associations, to conduct periodic stress tests. The 2025 scenario and background information can be found on the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (Company Run) page.

Home Publications & Resources Forms Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (Company Run) Share This Page: Purpose Section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank Act\") requires certain national banks and federal savings associations to conduct company-run stress tests. On October 9, 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published a rule (12 CFR 46) implementing the stress testing requirement and establishing definitions and requirements for the scope of application, scenarios, reporting, and disclosure. On October 10, 2019, the OCC issued another final rule, implementing changes made by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which revised the minimum threshold for stress testing to $250 billion, modified the frequency of company-run stress tests for certain national banks and federal savings associations, and reduced the number of required stress testing scenarios. Covered institutions are required to submit the results of their company-run stress tests to the OCC by April 5 and publish those results between June 15 and July 15. The OCC will provide the required scenarios to the covered institutions by February 15 of each year. The results of the company-run stress tests provide the OCC with forward-looking information used in bank supervision and assist the agency in assessing the company's risk profile and capital adequacy. The objective of the company-run stress test is to ensure that institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and to help ensure that institutions have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. The OCC intends to use the data to assess the reasonableness of the stress test results and determine whether additional analytical techniques are needed to identify, measure, and monitor risk. These stress test results are also expected to support ongoing improvement in a covered institution's stress testing practices with respect to its internal assessments of capital adequacy and overall capital planning. Frequency of Stress Testing The stress testing rule (12 CFR 46.5) requires a covered institution to conduct a stress test every other year, on even-numbered years, unless it is consolidated under a holding company that is required by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (under 12 CFR 252.54(a)(2)) to conduct an annual company-run stress test. Generally, covered institutions subject to Category III standards will only conduct company-run stress tests in even-numbered reporting years (e.g., April 5, 2022, 2024, etc.). While the annual stress test requirement applies to covered institutions subject to Category I or Category II standards. Scenarios The OCC releases economic and financial market scenarios that are used in the company-run stress test no later than February 15. The scenarios, which are not forecasts, include baseline and severely adverse scenarios. Each scenario includes economic variables, including macroeconomic activity, unemployment, exchange rates, prices, income, and interest rates. The severely adverse scenario is a hypothetical scenario designed to assess the strength and resilience of financial institutions. Reporting Templates These reporting templates collect quantitative projections of balance sheet, capital, losses, and income across several macroeconomic scenarios, along with qualitative information on methodologies. Covered institutions are required to complete reporting templates using financial information as of December 31 of each year. For current reporting cycle, the OCC has proposed the following templates and instructions: 2026 DFAST Templates and Instructions Templates Instructions Scenarios Technical Instructions .zip (Draft) .pdf (Draft) Pending Pending See prior year (2015-2025) DFAST templates, instructions, scenarios, and technical instructions Disclosure of Annual Stress Test Results The stress testing rule (12 CFR 46.8) requires a covered institution to publish a summary of the results of its stress test. The required summary of results may be published on the covered institution's website or in any other forum that is reasonably accessible to the public. A covered institution must publish a summary of the results of its stress test in the period starting June 15 and ending July 15. Unless the OCC determines otherwise, if the covered institution is a consolidated subsidiary of a holding company subject to supervisory stress tests conducted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board) pursuant to 12 CFR part 252, then within the June 15 to July 15 period such covered institution may not publish the required summary of its stress test earlier than the date that the Federal Reserve Board publishes the supervisory stress test results of the covered bank's parent holding company. Covered institutions are generally able to satisfy the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disclosure requirement through actions taken to meet the Federal Reserve Board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comparable requirement; however, the OCC reserves the right to require additional disclosure at its discretion.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-7 | January 31, 2025 OCC Promotes 2025 Earned Income Tax Credit Awareness Day Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094To help increase familiarity with the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is joining other agencies in promoting January 31 as EITC Awareness Day. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the EITC and its positive impact on America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working families. The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit for low- to moderate-income households. The EITC can reduce the amount of taxes owed on a worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earned income and, in some cases, increase the worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refund. Millions of workers may be eligible for EITC for the first time based on changes to their financial situation or their marital or parental status. Families with children may receive a refund of up to $7,830. Banks can play an important role by informing customers about EITC and reminding them to review qualifications to determine eligibility, including: having an earned income under $66,819 in tax year 2024, depending on marital or parental status. having investment income below $11,600 in the tax year 2024. having a valid Social Security number by the due date of the 2024 return. being a U.S. citizen or a resident alien during the entire 2024 tax year. In addition to promoting EITC awareness, the OCC encourages banks and federal savings associations to: share information about the EITC with their customers and stakeholders using social media or customer email and mailing lists. provide and promote low-cost bank products and services that enable tax refund recipients to deposit their income tax refunds directly into their accounts. inform customers about ways to use tax refunds to pay down debt and build savings. sponsor IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs in branches and support employees who volunteer as tax preparers in low- to moderate-income communities. OCC Community Affairs Officers can provide national banks and federal savings associations with information about the EITC and other initiatives.

The OCC also announced updates to its enforcement action search tool. The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are: Cease and Desist Order against Bank of America, N.A., Charlotte, North Carolina, for violations and unsafe or unsound practices related to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering, and sanctions compliance programs. Refer to OCC News Release 2024-140. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-56) The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are: Order of Prohibition and Order for Civil Money Penalty against Claudia Russ Anderson, former Community Bank Group Risk Officer at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for her failure to credibly challenge the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incentive compensation program, failure to institute effective controls to manage the risks posed by sales practices misconduct, and failure to escalate known or obvious risks related to sales practices misconduct, which contributed to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systemic problems with sales practices misconduct that lasted until 2016, as well as for obstructing the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examination of the bank. The assessed civil money penalty is $10 million. Refer to OCC News Release 2025-3. (Docket No. AA-EC-2019-81) Order of Prohibition against Brian Hernandez, former Financial Services Representative at a Queens, New York, branch of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for accessing the accounts of two elderly bank customers and making unauthorized ATM withdrawals totaling at least $187,000. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-86) Order of Prohibition against De\u00e2\u0080\u0099Anna Herrell, former Teller at an Atlanta, Georgia, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for cashing a series of checks that she knew or had reason to know were fraudulent, resulting in a loss of at least $117,000 to the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-41) Order to Cease and Desist and Order for Civil Money Penalty against David Julian, former Chief Auditor at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for his failure to plan and mange audit activity that would detect and document sales practices misconduct, failure to adequately escalate the sales practices misconduct, and failure to incorporate risk events in incentive compensation recommendations, which contributed to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systemic sales practices misconduct that lasted until 2016. The assessed civil money penalty is $7 million. Refer to OCC News Release 2025-3. (Docket No. AA-EC-2019-71) Order to Cease and Desist and Order for Civil Money Penalty against Paul McLinko, former Executive Audit Director at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for his failure to plan and manage audit activity that would detect and document sales practices misconduct, failure to adequately escalate the sales practices misconduct, and failure to maintain independence from the Community Bank line of business, which contributed to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systemic sales practices misconduct that lasted until 2016. The assessed civil money penalty is $1.5 million. Refer to OCC News Release 2025-3. (Docket No. AA-EC-2019-72) Order of Prohibition against Cassandra Meadows, former Lead Customer Service Representative at a Plainfield, Indiana, branch of Fifth Third Bank, N.A., Cincinnati, Ohio, for misappropriating at least $15,000 from the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vault and the accounts of three bank customers, including an elderly customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-97) Order of Prohibition against Isaiah Nicholson, former Customer Service Representative at Northfield Bank, Staten Island, New York, for misappropriating over $164,000 from two deceased bank customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accounts.

(Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-98) Order of Prohibition and Cease and Desist Order against David Wu, former Loan Officer at Sterling Bank and Trust, FSB, Southfield, Michigan, and current mortgage broker. While employed as a loan officer at Sterling, Wu did not disclose that he originated loans for clients of his closely held mortgage brokerage company. As a mortgage broker, Wu also used fraudulent means, including making false statements, concealing or otherwise not disclosing his role and fees, impersonating both applicants and their purported employers, and providing fraudulent or falsified documents, to cause Citizens Bank, N.A., Providence, Rhode Island, to originate mortgage loans for his clients and himself. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-109) The OCC also updated its enforcement actions search tool to allow users to search for enforcement actions issued since 2012 by subject matter and to easily view subject matters covered in those actions. This update provides additional transparency into and search capability for the contents of the public enforcement action database.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-4 | January 14, 2025 Federal and State Financial Regulatory Agencies Issue Interagency Statement on Supervisory Practices Regarding Financial Institutions Affected by the California Wildfires and Straight-line Winds Share This Page: Joint Release California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Reserve Board National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of the California wildfires and straight-line winds on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found at https:\/\/www.fema.gov\/disaster\/declarations. Lending: The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty should be accounted for as a new loan or a continuance of an existing loan. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and appropriately report the modification in the institution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call report. In supervising institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by the California wildfires and straight-line winds may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reporting requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https:\/\/www.ffiec.gov\/cra\/qnadoc.htm. Investments: Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.

Home News & Events Newsroom News Release 2025-3 | January 14, 2025 OCC Imposes Civil Money Penalties Against Three Former Executives of Wells Fargo Share This Page: WASHINGTON\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced enforcement actions against three former senior executives of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota (bank). These actions were taken in response to the former executives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unsafe or unsound banking practices related to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systemic and widespread sales practices misconduct. The enforcement actions are described in two written decisions issued by Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu, covering Claudia Russ Anderson and jointly covering David Julian and Paul McLinko, as follows: Name Former Position Relief Ordered Claudia Russ Anderson Community Bank Group Risk Officer Prohibition Order and $10,000,000 Civil Money Penalty (CMP) David Julian Chief Auditor Personal Cease & Desist Order and $7,000,000 CMP Paul McLinko Executive Audit Director Personal Cease & Desist Order and $1,500,000 CMP The decision covering Ms. Anderson found that from 2013 to 2016, she failed to credibly challenge the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incentive compensation program, failed to institute effective controls to manage risks posed by sales practices misconduct, failed to escalate known or obvious risks, and repeatedly and consistently downplayed the sales practices misconduct. The decision also noted that Ms. Anderson committed violations of law by failing to provide information or providing false, incomplete, or misleading information to the OCC during its 2015 examinations. A separate decision concluded that during the same period, Mr. Julian and Mr. McLinko failed to plan and manage audit activity that would detect and document sales practices misconduct and failed to adequately escalate the sales practices misconduct. Mr. McLinko also failed to maintain professional independence from the Community Bank, the Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest business line that housed the retail branches. The decisions issued today explained that under pressure to meet unreasonable sales goals, thousands of employees at the bank engaged in widespread sales practices misconduct. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written decisions and orders stem from the Notice of Charges the OCC filed in January 2020, which began the administrative litigation. An Administrative Law Judge issued three recommended decisions in December 2022 following a 38-day administrative hearing. These are the remaining outstanding enforcement actions among those that the OCC pursued against 11 individuals related to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systemic and widespread sales practices misconduct. The OCC previously reached resolution with eight other former Wells Fargo senior bank executives, resulting in their payment of civil money penalties totaling $43,175,000.
