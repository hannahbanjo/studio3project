Remarks at the Women in Housing and Finance Public Policy Luncheon
“The Fraud Challenge”
December 11, 2024
The increasing prevalence of financial fraud presents a special challenge for us as a
society. While fraud does not have the profile of Basel 3 or cyber risk, its everyday impact in
people’s daily lives warrants attention. Fraud not only harms consumers, but also leads to distrust
in others, in institutions, and in the financial system. Effectively addressing this challenge is
going to require all stakeholders—from banks to social media platforms—to each pull their
weight and to act above and beyond what is currently legally required.
The situation reminds me of trash left on the street. I live in the city. Technically, litter
that is not on my property is not my concern. I have no obligation to pick it up. Neither do my
neighbors. And yet if no one picks up the errant bits of litter when they walk by, then more litter
tends to appear. Passersby feel it is OK to drop their wrapper on the ground or leave their empty
cup on the sidewalk when others have done so. Each act of littering and walking by litter is
relatively small. But the cumulative effect is palpable. The neighborhood becomes less nice, less
inviting, less orderly, less valued, and can even feel less safe. Over time, if left unaddressed, the
situation becomes accepted as normal.
The steady rise and pervasiveness of fraud today presents each stakeholder, including
regulators, with a choice. If everyone does only the minimum of what is legally required of them, consumers will continue to be harmed, people’s distrust in each other and in institutions will
continue to rise, and elevated levels of fraud will become normalized.
The most efficient and effective way to avoid this outcome would be for each and every
stakeholder to step up and do their part to combat fraud. This would mean getting in the habit of
leaning down and picking up the proverbial trash instead of just walking by it, even if doing so
isn’t legally required.
Fortunately, the banks I’ve spoken to about addressing fraud are open to this; many have
already begun to act.
First, I should note the importance of complying with existing laws and regulations to
promptly identify, investigate, and resolve fraud concerns, such as under the Expedited Funds
Availability Act (Regulation CC), and to address potentially unfair practices prohibited under
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 1031 of the Dodd–Frank Act. When
consumers fall victim to fraud or scams, they should have confidence that their bank will comply
with applicable laws when researching potentially fraudulent check, debit, and credit card
transactions, including the provisional credit requirements of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act
(Regulation E) and the billing error requirements of the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z).
Second, we’ve seen many banks increase their individual efforts to address fraud. These
efforts include providing bank customers with relevant information about trending scams and
how to avoid them and improving or tightening fraud detection and monitoring systems to
identify potential frauds in a timely manner. I have heard countless stories of bank branch
employees going the extra mile to educate customers about the risks of wiring all their funds to a
suspicious account.
2 Third, several bank trade groups have formed fraud task forces to collaborate and share
information. For example, the American Bankers Association (ABA) has created a check fraud
claim directory,1 which is intended to help banks needing to file a check warranty breach claim
with another financial institution. The Independent Community Bankers of America formed a
check fraud task force of banks and state bankers’ associations and leads a financial sector fraud
working group.2 And Early Warning System (EWS), which operates the bank-owned Zelle
network and was recently cited by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for
various weaknesses,3 has taken steps to further strengthen its fraud detection program.
While these and other initiatives are promising and more needs to be done, banks and
industry trade groups cannot effectively address fraud all by themselves. Take, for instance,
check fraud. The recent rise in check fraud can be traced in large part to bad actors intercepting
checks sent through the U.S. Post Office. To combat this, the ABA and the U.S. Postal
Inspection Service announced a joint effort to combat check fraud in March 2024.4 The joint
initiative focuses on educating U.S. Postal Service and bank customers, addressing money mules
and collusive accountholders, collaborating with law enforcement, and training bank employees
and postal workers on red flags and prevention.

Fail to Protect Consumers From Fraud,” July 23, 2024.

Fraud,” March 19, 2024.
3 Similarly, a significant amount of fraud on peer-to-peer payment platforms originates
from users responding to unsolicited text messages, emails, and social media posts.5 In the
United Kingdom, where liability for such fraud has been assigned to banks, several banking
organizations have established a partnership with Meta, the owner of Facebook, to share
information via a Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange. While relatively new, reports indicate
that in an early pilot, Meta removed 20,000 scam accounts based on the collaboration.6
In a sign that fraud may be becoming normalized, so-called first party fraud is also on the
rise. Take, for instance, the recent check-kiting social media posts regarding JPMorgan ATMs
that went viral on TikTok. A temporary technical glitch let customers deposit large checks in
ATMs and withdraw funds immediately before the checks could clear. Recent media reports
noted that the bank is investigating thousands of possible check fraud incidents related to this
ATM glitch.7
A laissez-faire view of this might conclude that as long as no laws or regulations are
being violated, elevated levels of fraud may simply be the new normal, the cost of innovation
5 Federal Trade Commission, “Who Experiences Scams? A Story for All Ages,” December 8, 2022. For instance,
according to data from the Federal Trade Commission, in 2021 social media was the single biggest starting point for
scams against Americans ages 18–59; 31 percent of people in that age range who reported losing money to a scam
said that the scheme started on social media. For those ages 18–29, nearly 40 percent of those who reported losing
money to a scam said the scam originated on social media. Among adults 60 years or older, that percentage was 15
percent. See also Payment Systems Regulator Ltd., Authorised Push Payment (APP) Scams Performance Report,
July 2024.

4, 2024; Reuters, “JPMorgan Sues Customers Over Check Fraud Linked to Glitch That Went Viral,” October 28,
2024.
4 and technological advancement. I believe this underestimates the cumulative sense of disorder
and distrust that can emanate from seemingly small but repeated acts of fraud.8
As with many collective action problems, public-private partnerships can be effective.
For instance, coordination and information-sharing efforts focused on cyber risks provide a
useful model for consideration. At the OCC, we are focused on supporting and encouraging these
and other collaborative fraud education and fraud prevention efforts. In addition, we are
regularly engaging with our partners in interagency and international efforts to strengthen
regulatory and supervisory responses to financial fraud. This includes participating in various
working groups with representatives from industry, financial regulators, and law enforcement.
Banks and bank regulators can and will need to do more to address fraud. But they cannot
solve the problem on their own. Social media platforms, telecommunication companies, email
hosts, the U.S. Postal Service, and law enforcement need to step up and do their part as well to
keep the proverbial streets clean, safe, and trusted. The OCC looks forward to continued and
enhanced collaboration with all stakeholders to address this important issue.

For purposes of the request for information, payments fraud generally refers to the use of illegal means to make or receive payments for personal gain, including scams. Because payments fraud may involve multiple institutions and payment methods, no single agency or private-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. Therefore, the agencies are seeking public comment on discrete actions, collectively or independently, to mitigate payments fraud, including check fraud, within their respective bank regulation and payments authorities. Input is requested on five potential areas for improvement and collaboration: External collaboration among the agencies, Federal Reserve Banks, and industry stakeholders; Consumer, business, and industry education by the agencies and Federal Reserve Banks to educate about payments fraud; Regulation and supervision to mitigate payments fraud, including opportunities the Board may have related to check fraud; Payments fraud data collection and information sharing; and Federal Reserve Banksâ operator tools and services to reduce payments fraud. In addition to seeking public input, the agencies will also continue looking for additional opportunities to effectively collaborate across other state and federal agencies given the importance of interagency coordination to help mitigate payments fraud.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Introduction
Payments fraud inflicts significant harm on consumers, businesses, and financial
institutions. Payments fraud also has the potential to erode public trust in—and
undermine the safety, accessibility, and efficiency of—the nation’s payments system,
upon which the U.S. financial system depends. As part of their objectives to promote the
safety of the U.S. financial system, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC have overlapping but also
discrete roles and authorities related to the issue of payments fraud. For example, the
Board, FDIC, and OCC all engage in supervision of financial institutions. In addition to
supervising financial institutions, the FDIC has the distinct mission to maintain stability
and public confidence in the nation’s financial system as the insurer of bank deposits.
The FRS, which includes the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks), also
focuses on payment system safety as a payment system operator and catalyst for payment
system improvements. Therefore, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC are each interested in
exploring ways to help mitigate risk of payments fraud. Given that the FRS, FDIC, and
OCC have specific differing roles and authorities, this mitigation could take the form of
collective action where roles align, such as joint supervisory guidance, or independent
7 of 22 action where roles differ, such as changes to the payment systems operated by the
Reserve Banks.
II. Background
While there is no consensus on the definition of “payments fraud,” for purposes of
this RFI, “payments fraud” generally refers to the use of illegal means, including
intentional deception, misrepresentation, or manipulation, to make or receive payments
for personal gain.1 The term “payments fraud” also includes scams, a subset of fraud.2
Many sources indicate that payments fraud is growing. For example, according to
data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), losses reported for noncard payments
fraud increased 271 percent between 2020 and 2024.3 Data from the U.S. Department of
the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) show that the number
of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed related to check, ACH, and wire fraud have
increased 489 percent between 2014 and 2024.4

Different (Dec. 7, 2023), https://www.gao.gov/assets/d24106608.pdf and U.S. Department of Justice,
Bureau of Justice Statistics, Financial Fraud, https://bjs.ojp.gov/taxonomy/term/financial-fraud.

https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/news/blog/defined-scams-to-fight-scams.
3 See FTC Consumer Sentinel Network Fraud Reports, All Fraud Reports by Payment Method,
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/federal.trade.commission/viz/FraudReports/FraudFacts (“Payment
& Contact Methods” tab). Specifically, these figures indicate that fraud reports for payments apps or
services, bank transfers or payments, wire transfers, and checks have increased from 145,358 in 2020,
resulting in a loss of $806 million, to more than 188,000 in 2024, resulting in a loss of $2.99 billion.

stats/sar-filings-industry (Exhibit 5: Number of Filings by Type of Suspicious Activity from Depository
Institution Industry, 2024 data) with FinCEN, Suspicious Activity Report Statistics (SAR Stats),
https://www.fincen.gov/reports/sar-stats (Industry Type: Depository Institution, Year & Month: 2024 (all
months), Suspicious Activity Category/Type: Fraud > ACH, Check, Wire).
8 of 22 The rise in check fraud is particularly notable. Numerous sources report
increasing levels of check fraud in recent years, despite overall decreases in check usage.5
Checks can be stolen, altered, or forged. For instance, the physical nature of paper
checks makes them susceptible to theft while in transit or when left in unsecured
locations. Products and services to detect altered or forged checks during the clearing
process have varying degrees of effectiveness given that checks do not inherently include
explicit security features. Checks also contain sensitive information—including the
payor’s name, account number, routing number, address, and signature—that can be used
by criminals to conduct other forms of payments fraud.
A payments fraud scheme may involve multiple institutions and payment
methods, each of which may fall within the remit of different Federal and State agencies.
As a result, and given the scope and complexity of payments fraud schemes, no agency or
private-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. The Board, FDIC, and OCC
nonetheless may be able to take certain discrete steps, collectively or independently, to
mitigate payments fraud through their various roles discussed further below, such as
regulator and supervisor. In addition, Reserve Banks may be able to further support the
industry in addressing fraud as payments system operator and payments improvement
catalyst.
Therefore, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC are considering whether additional actions
may be warranted, collectively or independently in their different roles. Given the
5 For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury reports that check fraud in the United States has risen
385 percent since the COVID-19 pandemic. See Department of the Treasury, Treasury Announces
Enhanced Fraud Detection Process Using AI Recovers $375M in Fiscal Year 2023 (Feb. 28, 2024),
https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2134. FinCEN reports that check fraud accounted for
approximately 30 percent of fraud-related SARs filed in 2023. See SAR Stats,
https://www.fincen.gov/reports/sar-stats.
9 of 22 complexity and scope of payments fraud, input and engagement from a variety of
stakeholders will be helpful to identify and evaluate the range of potential actions to
consider.
III. Request for Information
As explained below, comment is requested on five potential areas for
improvement and collaboration that could help mitigate payments fraud:
 External collaboration (questions 1–4)
 Consumer, business, and industry education (questions 5–8)
 Regulation and supervision (questions 9–15)
 Payments fraud data collection and information sharing (questions 16–20)
 Reserve Banks’ operator tools and services (questions 21–22)
Commenters are also invited to provide perspectives related to payments fraud more
generally (questions 23-26).
Where comments apply to only a subset of the FRS, FDIC, and OCC, please
identify the relevant entity or entities.
External Collaboration
The FRS, FDIC, and OCC collaborate with stakeholders in various ways to
support the safety and efficiency of the U.S. financial system. For example, the Board,
FDIC, and OCC, together with other Federal and State agencies, issued guidance on elder
financial exploitation.6 More recently, the Reserve Banks collaborated with various

10 of 22 industry stakeholders to launch the FraudClassifierSM model in 2020 and
ScamClassifierSM model in 2024 to help address the industry-wide challenge of
inconsistent classifications for payments fraud.7 Additionally, the FRS in its role as
payment system improvement catalyst worked with the payments and banking industry
and other stakeholders to develop strategies for improving the U.S. payments system,
which resulted in the introduction of instant payments in the United States.8 There may
be opportunities to facilitate further collaboration among industry stakeholders to better
address payments fraud. Commenters are invited to respond to the following questions:
1. What actions could increase collaboration among stakeholders to address
payments fraud?
2. What types of collaboration, including standard setting, could be most effective in
addressing payments fraud? What are some of the biggest obstacles to these types
of collaboration?
3. Which organizations outside of the payments or banking industry might provide
additional insights related to payments fraud and be effective collaborators in
detecting, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?
4. Could increased collaboration among Federal and State agencies help detect,
prevent, and mitigate payments fraud? If so, how?

11 of 22 Consumer, Business, and Industry Education
Consumers, businesses, financial institutions, and other industry stakeholders
currently have access to education on a range of financial topics, including payments
fraud.9 However, there may be a need for further education specific to payments fraud.
Effective payments fraud education could, for example, help industry stakeholders
identify suspected payments fraud and better inform affected parties about what steps to
take following an incident of payments fraud. The effectiveness of any payments fraud
education, however, may be undermined by the ever-evolving nature of payments fraud,
the highly specific and sensitive nature of these crimes, and the range of potentially
inconsistent guidance from multiple sources.
To assist in developing potential new payments fraud education, commenters are
invited to respond to the following questions:
5. In general, what types of payments fraud education are most effective, and why?
Would different audiences (for example, industry and consumers) benefit from
different types of payments fraud education?
6. Would additional education informing consumers and businesses about safe
payment practices be helpful to reduce payments fraud and promote access to
safe, secure payment options?
9 For example, the OCC recently launched “Safe Money,” a series of informational facts sheets to help
consumers recognize and avoid common financial frauds and scams at https://www.occ.gov/publications-
and-resources/publications/safe-money/index-safe-money.html. The Federal Reserve offers consumer
advice and educational resources on its website at
https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/fraud-scams.htm and through each Reserve Bank’s
website. The Federal Reserve also provides consumer alerts, an avenue for consumer complaints, and other
relevant resources on payments fraud at https://www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov. The FDIC provides
periodic newsletters to consumers, providing practical guidance on how to become a smarter, safer user of
financial services, including helpful hints, quick tips, and common-sense strategies to protect and stretch
your hard-earned dollars. This includes topics such as scammers, fake banks, or fraud against the elderly.
See https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/fdic-consumer-news for more information.
12 of 22 7. Which approaches could make existing payments fraud education more effective?
For example, would targeting outreach to particular audiences or conducting
additional education in collaboration with other key stakeholders be effective?
8. Are current online resources effective in providing education on payments fraud?
If not, how could they be improved?10
Regulation and Supervision
While no agency has plenary regulatory or supervisory authority over the U.S.
payments system, the Board, FDIC, and OCC have certain limited, and in some cases
unique, statutory authorities that may apply to payments fraud.11 For example, the Board,
FDIC, and OCC supervise their respective financial institutions for compliance with their
obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering regime to identify,
prevent, and report illicit financial activity including fraud. Additionally, the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act requires the protection of nonpublic personal information as
implemented by the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security
Standards.12 The Board, FDIC, and OCC also supervise their respective financial

and-resources/publications/safe-money/index-safe-money.html; and https://www.occ.gov/topics/consumers-
and-communities/consumer-protection/fraud-resources/index-fraud-resources.html.
11 While no single Federal agency has regulatory authority to address all aspects of payments fraud, there
are a variety of Federal and State laws and regulations applicable to payments fraud detection, mitigation,
and resolution, often specific to the type of transaction and parties involved.
12 The Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards (Guidelines) set forth standards
pursuant to section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, and sections 501 and
505(b), 15 U.S.C. 6801 and 6805(b), of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These Guidelines address standards
for developing and implementing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security,
confidentiality, and integrity of customer information. These Guidelines also address standards with respect
to the proper disposal of consumer information pursuant to sections 621 and 628 of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s and 1681w).
13 of 22 institutions for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, such as the
Expedited Funds Availability Act (implemented in Regulation CC), the Electronic Fund
Transfer Act (implemented in Regulation E), the Truth in Lending Act (implemented in
Regulation Z), and prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.13
Although the Board, FDIC, and OCC believe that they are exercising their authorities
appropriately, there may be opportunities to take additional regulatory or supervisory
actions to address payments fraud within their authorities and, where appropriate, in
coordination with other agencies.
In considering potential additional regulatory or supervisory actions to mitigate
payments fraud, the Board, FDIC, and OCC seek comment on the following questions.
Additionally, there may be opportunities specific to check fraud that the Board could
consider with respect to Regulation CC given its rule-writing authority, which is
discussed separately below.
9. What potential changes to regulations (apart from the Board’s Regulation CC,
discussed separately below) could address payments fraud and mitigate the harms
from payments fraud to consumers, businesses, and supervised institutions?
10. The Board, FDIC, and OCC have issued supervisory guidance on numerous
topics that relate to payments fraud detection, prevention, and mitigation.14 Is
13 The Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFA Act), among other things, prescribes the maximum
permissible hold periods for checks and other deposits. The Board implements certain provisions of the
EFA Act with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
14 The Board, FDIC, and OCC have issued supervisory guidance on operational risk management,
compliance risk management, third-party risk management, and model risk management. For example, the
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, of which the Board, FDIC, and OCC are members,
issued guidance that provides financial institutions with examples of effective authentication and access
risk management principles, and practices for customers, employees, and third parties accessing digital
banking services and information systems. See Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council,
Authentication and Access to Financial Institution Services and Systems (Aug. 11, 2021),
14 of 22 existing supervisory guidance related to payments fraud sufficient and clear? If
not, what new or revised supervisory guidance should the Board, FDIC, and OCC
consider issuing on this topic within the respective authorities?
11. How might new or revised supervisory guidance assist small community banks in
detecting, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?
12. What is the experience of consumers and businesses when supervised institutions
place holds on depositors’ funds because of suspected payments fraud?
(Regulation CC’s “reasonable cause to doubt collectability” exception is
discussed separately below.)
a) For instance, how frequently are consumers and businesses affected by
holds, delays, or account freezes, and how responsive are supervised
institutions to inquiries from consumers and businesses regarding these
issues?
b) Do current disclosure requirements effectively address consumer and
business concerns when supervised institutions hold customer funds due to
suspected payments fraud? For example, should changes be considered
with respect to permissible customer communications under SAR
confidentiality rules?
https://www.ffiec.gov/guidance/Authentication-and-Access-to-Financial-Institution-Services-and-
Systems.pdf. The Board, FDIC, and OCC, together with other Federal and State agencies, issued guidance
on elder financial exploitation. See Interagency Statement on Elder Financial Exploitation (Dec. 4, 2024),
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20241204a.htm;
https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-12/interagency-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation.pdf; and
https://www.occ.gov/topics/consumers-and-communities/consumer-protection/fraud-resources/index-fraud-
resources.html. As required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Federal banking agencies have issued
interagency guidelines establishing information security standards. See, e.g., 12 CFR part 208, app. D-2,
and part 225, app. F. Finally, OCC Bulletin 2019-37 outlines sound fraud risk management principles at
https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2019/bulletin-2019-37.html.
15 of 22 13. The Board, FDIC, and OCC have received complaints from supervised
institutions regarding challenges in resolving disputes about liability for allegedly
fraudulent checks.15 What is the experience of supervised institutions when trying
to resolve these types of interbank disputes regarding allegedly fraudulent checks?
Do these types of interbank disputes arise more frequently in connection with
certain types of checks or parties? What actions could the Board, FDIC, and OCC
consider, including potential amendments by the Board to Regulation CC, that
could improve supervised institutions’ ability to resolve interbank disputes over
liability for allegedly fraudulent checks?
Although the Board is not proposing any changes to Regulation CC at this time,
the Board seeks comment on the following questions:
14. Regulation CC seeks to balance prompt funds availability with the risk of checks
being returned unpaid for reasons that include fraud. What potential amendments
to Regulation CC would support timely access to funds from check deposits while
providing depository institutions with sufficient time to identify suspected
payments fraud?
a) Have technological advancements in check processing reduced the time it
takes for depository institutions to learn of nonpayment or fraud such that
funds availability requirements for local checks and nonproprietary ATMs
should be shortened?16
15 The Board, OCC, and FDIC have each established mailboxes to receive interbank complaints about this
issue concerning their supervised financial institutions.
16 The funds availability requirements for cash deposits, wire transfers, and government and certain other
types of checks are established by the EFA Act. See 12 U.S.C. 4002(a). The EFA Act requires the Board
and CFPB to reduce the time periods for certain other check and ATM deposits to as short a time as
16 of 22 b) What effects would shortening funds availability requirements have on
payments fraud, consumers who rely on timely access to funds, and
depository institutions?
c) Are there any changes the Board should consider to the expeditious return
requirement to better balance providing expeditious notice to the receiving
depository institution with ensuring adequate time for the paying
depository institution to investigate potentially fraudulent checks?17
15. Regulation CC provides six exceptions that allow depository institutions to extend
deposit hold periods for certain types of deposits, including deposits for which the
depository institution has reasonable cause to doubt the collectability of a
check.18 Is this exception effective in allowing depository institutions to mitigate
check fraud while also allowing timely access to funds? Would depository
institutions benefit from further clarification on when it may be appropriate to
invoke this exception? What are the experiences of businesses and consumers
when depository institutions invoke this exception in order to delay the
availability of depositors’ funds?
possible and equal to the period of time achievable for a receiving depository institution to reasonably
expect to learn of the nonpayment of most items for each category. 12 U.S.C. 4002(d)(1). In October
2024, an interested person submitted a rulemaking petition to the Board and CFPB requesting that both
agencies engage in a rulemaking process to shorten maximum permissible hold times for checks and funds
deposited by customers. The Board views this rulemaking petition as an additional consideration related to
the issuance of this RFI. In response to the growth in electronic processing, the Reserve Banks reduced the
number of their paper check-processing offices from 45 in 2003 to a single office in 2010. The
consolidation resulted in all checks being considered ""local checks"" under Regulation CC.
17 Regulation CC requires a depository institution that determines not to pay a check to return the check
expeditiously so that receiving depository institutions are more likely to learn of a return before making
funds available. See 12 CFR 229.31(b).
18 See 12 CFR 229.13(e).
17 of 22 Payments Fraud Data Collection and Information Sharing
Payments fraud data, such as value and volume of fraudulent payments and
industry negative lists, is currently collected in an incomplete, non-standardized, ad hoc,
and fragmented way.19 For example, not all entities in the payments and banking
industry collect payments fraud data, especially authorized payments that are a part of a
scam or fraud. Further, existing data sources may focus on particular payment methods,
types of payments fraud, or segments of the industry, and may use different definitions of
payments fraud. Further promoting, standardizing, and centralizing payments fraud data
collection and information sharing could provide a more comprehensive understanding of
the prevalence and impact of payments fraud. These improvements also could aid in
identifying payments fraud schemes that are being repeated across payment methods and
institutions, allowing for the development of more-informed, holistic strategies to address
payments fraud.
However, there may be barriers to improving payments fraud data collection and
information sharing. Payments fraud may be underreported because of the reluctance of
victims to report fraud due to embarrassment or shame, confusion regarding the proper
reporting channel, and a perception that reporting does not lead to remediation. Further,
19 For example, the FTC maintains a website where consumers can report payments fraud. See
https://reportfraud.ftc.gov. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center is the main federal law
enforcement hub for reporting cyber-enabled crime, which includes payments fraud. See
https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2024_IC3Report.pdf. In addition, depository institutions are
required to file SARs with FinCEN following suspected incidents of payments fraud. FRS has previously
collected payments fraud data in connection with its Federal Reserve Payments Study, which it published
in 2014 and 2018. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, The 2013 Federal Reserve
Payments Study: Recent and Long-Term Payment Trends in the United States: 2000-2012 (July 2014),
https://www.frbservices.org/binaries/content/assets/crsocms/news/research/2013-fed-res-paymt-study-
detailed-rpt.pdf. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Changes in U.S. Payments Fraud
from 2012 to 2016: Evidence from the Federal Reserve Payments Study (Oct. 2018),
https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/changes-in-us-payments-fraud-from-2012-to-2016-
20181016.pdf.
18 of 22 potential risks associated with sharing payments fraud–related information may prevent
sharing across stakeholders.
To assist in potentially promoting improved payments fraud data collection and
information sharing, commenters are invited to respond to the following questions:
16. Broadly, how could payments fraud data collection and information sharing be
improved?
17. What barriers limit the collection and sharing of payments fraud data between
industry stakeholders, and how could these barriers be alleviated? For example,
have specific barriers limited development of solutions or participation in
bilaterial or multilateral payments fraud data collection and information sharing?
What changes would address these barriers?
18. What role should the FRS, FDIC, or OCC take in supporting further
standardization of payments fraud data? For instance, can the FRS better leverage
or improve the FraudClassifierSM and ScamClassifierSM models?
19. What types of payments fraud data, if available, would have the largest impact on
addressing payments fraud? If these data are not currently being collected or
shared, what entities are best positioned to collect and share such data?
20. Is there a need for centralized databases or repositories for the sharing of
payments fraud data across entities? What legal, privacy, or practical risks and
challenges could such a centralized database or repository pose? Which entities
are best positioned to develop and participate in a centralized database or
repository?
19 of 22 Reserve Banks’ Operator Tools and Services
The Reserve Banks offer check processing, ACH transfers, instant payments, and
wire services, among other services. In this operational role, the Reserve Banks have
taken important steps to prevent and mitigate payments fraud. For example, the Reserve
Banks provide risk management tools and services that participating financial institutions
may use as part of their payments fraud detection, prevention, and mitigation programs.20
The FRS believes that there may be further opportunities for the Reserve Banks, as a
payments system operator, to provide additional tools and services designed to reduce
payments fraud.
In considering potential additional actions the Reserve Banks can take in their
operator role to mitigate payments fraud, commenters are invited to respond to the
following questions:
21. How can the Reserve Banks enhance their existing risk management tools and
services, operations, rules, or procedures to better meet the needs of participating
financial institutions in addressing payments fraud? For example, should the
Reserve Banks consider requiring fraud reporting for payment rails (as they
already do for the FedNow® Service) or adopting any particular payments fraud
standards?
20 See https://www.frbservices.org for more information on Reserve Bank financial services, including risk
management and fraud tools and services. Examples of these tools and services include FedDetect®
Anomaly Notification for FedACH® Services, FedACH® Exception Resolution Service, FedDetect®
Duplicate Notification for Check Services, FedACH® Risk Origination Monitoring Service, FedACH®
RDFI File Alert Service, FedPayments® Reporter for Check Services Corporate Payor Report, FedNow®
Service network- and participant-level transaction limits, and FedNow® Service participant defined
negative lists.
20 of 22 22. Are there risk management tools or services that the Reserve Banks should
consider offering or expanding, such as a) developing a payments fraud contact
directory for financial institutions, b) offering tools that can provide notification
of atypical payment activity, or c) introducing confirmation of payee services to
help mitigate fraudulent payment origination?21
General Questions
In addition to the more specific questions above, commenters are invited to
respond to the following general questions related to payments fraud:
23. What types of payments fraud have most impacted your organization and its
stakeholders? What tactics have criminals employed when perpetrating these
types of payments fraud?
24. What measures, including technological solutions or services, have been most
effective in identifying, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud at your
institution? Are there actions that consumers can take that help institutions? For
example, do financial institutions find it helpful when consumers alert the
institution in advance when making large purchases, transferring large amounts of
money, and traveling abroad?
25. To the extent not already addressed here, are there other actions that would
support stakeholders in identifying, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?
21 Some payments systems have implemented services known as confirmation of payee, which are designed
to reduce payments fraud by enabling senders to review key payment information, such as the name
associated with the intended account.
21 of 22 26. Are there specific actions that commenters believe could encourage the use of
payment methods with strong security features?

How It Works Check fraud occurs when an unauthorized person uses someone elseâs checks, or images of a check, to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals. Common Methods of Check Fraud Check fraud: Scammers steal, or forge checks to make unauthorized transactions. Check washing: Fraudsters alter or âwashâ legitimate checks with chemicals to erase the ink from a check to rewrite amounts and payees. Mail fraud: Defrauding others by sending or receiving fraudulent checks through the mail. Warning Signs Unfamiliar checking account transactions appear on your bank statements. Your bank notifies you of unauthorized account activity. You receive calls from your bank about checks you didnât write or transactions you didnât make. Someone unsolicited contacts you with a request to deposit a check for any reason, especially to make money on a limited time offer of any kind. You receive a check in the mail related to employment as a mystery shopper, personal assistant, or for being the winner of a prize. Ways to Avoid It Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Set up account alerts for all transactions and review your statements frequently for unauthorized charges or unusual and suspicious activity. Use black gel ink on checks: Black gel ink is highly resistant to check washing, a common scheme where chemicals are used to erase ink from a check to rewrite amounts and payees. Get mail promptly after delivery and avoid leaving mail in your mailbox overnight. When sending checks, consider using the letter slots in your post office to send mail. Be wary of sending money or any medium of payment to someone after taking a check from them for any reason. Scammers often claim overpayment or demand you send or wire money after they give you a bad check. Ways to Report It Taking prompt and comprehensive action when faced with check fraud can help mitigate any potential damage and ensure that the fraudulent charges are resolved effectively. Notify your financial institution Bank: Inform your bank about the fraudulent transaction. Dispute any unauthorized charges and consider requesting your account be closed and a new account opened. Report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Online: Submit a complaint to the IC3, a division of the FBI. This is especially useful for internet-related crimes.

Fraudsters might sell counterfeit goods or use fake retail sites to steal money from consumers. Common Methods of Consumer Product and Retail Fraud Counterfeit goods: Selling fake or substandard products at high prices or selling high-end products at âtoo good to be trueâ prices. Online auction scams: Scammers lure buyers with fake auction listings and collect payment without delivering the item. Retail return fraud: Individuals use various deceptive methods such as a false identity to return products for a refund, store credit, or exchange. Warning Signs Deeply discounted products or offers that seem too good to be true. Sellers who request unusual payment methods, like wire transfers, gift cards, or cryptocurrency. Little to no information about the sellerâs company, including no return policy or contact details. Receiving counterfeit goods or items that donât match the advertised product description. Misleading advertising: False claims about a productâs capabilities or features. Non-delivery of goods: Payment made but no product received. Warranty and return scams: Issues with a productâs warranty or return policy deception. Ways to Avoid It Research sellers: Only buy from reputable retailers and read customer reviews before making purchases. Be skeptical of deals: If a deal seems too good to be true, it likely is. Avoid offers that promise unusually low prices. Review return policies: Ensure the seller has clear return and refund policies and avoid purchasing from sites that lack transparency.

How It Works Credit card and debit card fraud occurs when a person uses someone elseâs card or card information to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals. This can happen through physical theft of the card or by stealing card information online or through card skimming devices. Common Methods of Credit Card and Debit Card Fraud Account takeover: A fraudster takes control of a credit or debit card account to make unauthorized transactions. Card-not-present fraud: An unauthorized person uses stolen card details to make online purchases. Card skimming: Devices capture card information at ATMs or point-of-sale terminals, such as at gas pumps. Mail fraud: A scheme by a fraudster to intercept a credit or debit card from the mail before the intended account holder receives it. Phone thefts and fraud: Fraudsters target smartphones to access sensitive financial information, digital cards, banking apps, and wallets stored on the device.

Small dollar authorizations or transactions are used to âtestâ an account prior to much larger transaction activity. Your bank notifies you of unauthorized account activity. You receive calls from your bank about transactions you didnât make. Ways to Avoid It Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Set up account alerts for all transactions and review your statements frequently for unauthorized charges or unusual and suspicious activity. Use secure payment methods: When shopping online, ensure the website is secure (look for âhttpsâ in the URL) and avoid saving payment information on websites. Be cautious with ATMs and other point-of-sale terminals: Use ATMs located at secure, well-lit locations, and cover the keypad when entering your PIN to prevent skimming devices from capturing your information. Check if any parts of a point-of-sale terminal are loose or wiggle. Keep your cards secure: Never share your card details with anyone, and report lost or stolen cards immediately.

These fraudsters often use threats of legal action or arrest to force payments. Common Methods of Debt Collection Fraud Debt settlement scams: Fraudsters provide false promises to settle debts in exchange for upfront fees. Fake lawsuits or arrest claims: Fraudsters threaten consumers with lawsuits or arrest for unpaid debts to force payment. Phony debt collectors: Scammers demand immediate payment for fake or non-existent debts. Warning Signs Receiving calls or letters from debt collectors for debts you donât recognize or owe. Threats of arrest, legal action, or wage garnishment if payment isnât made immediately. Refusal by the caller to provide written verification of the debt. Demands for payment via wire transfers, prepaid cards, or gift cards. Ways to Avoid It Request written verification: Always ask for written proof of the debt from the lender or servicer before making any payments. Know your rights: Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), you are entitled to dispute a debt and request verification. Do not share personal information: Never provide sensitive information, like your Social Security number or bank details, to unsolicited callers. Ways to Report It Scammers pretend to be legitimate debt collectors, often attempting to collect on non-existent or fake debts using threats or intimidation so it is important to take action to mitigate any potential damage and ensure that the fraudsters are reported to the proper authorities.

Fraudsters exploit the popularity of gift cards as convenient presents by tricking individuals into purchasing gift cards for fictitious reasons or stealing funds from purchased cards. These scams are particularly effective during the holiday rush, as people may be less vigilant and more likely to fall for high-pressure tactics or deals that appear time-sensitive.

The amendments align with changes that are being concurrently proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a result of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act). The agencies and FinCEN are also issuing a joint statement that describes their proposed rules and the additional steps necessary to implement the AML Act. Note for Community Bank The proposed amendments would apply to all national banks and all federal savings associations, including community banks. Highlights The notice of proposed rulemaking would propose the following changes, among others: Incorporating a risk assessment process in AML/CFT program rules that would require, among other things, consideration of national AML/CFT priorities published by FinCEN. Including customer due diligence requirements to reflect prior amendments to FinCENâs requirements. Including amendments to codify longstanding supervisory expectations and conform to changes made by the AML Act. Encouraging, but not requiring, banks to consider, evaluate, and as appropriate, implement innovative approaches to meet compliance obligations pursuant to the BSA. Background Pursuant to the AML Act, FinCEN is amending its BSA compliance program rules to incorporate national AML/CFT priorities and other changes. The agencies have independent authority to prescribe regulations requiring banks to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor their compliance with the requirements of the BSA. The agencies are proposing to amend their rules concurrently with FinCEN. In 2016, FinCEN amended its AML compliance program rules to incorporate customer due diligence (CDD) requirements, adding beneficial ownership information collection requirements into FinCENâs AML compliance program rule for certain financial institutions, including banks. The proposed rule would add CDD as a required component of the agenciesâ AML/CFT program rules, which would mirror FinCENâs existing rule.

BSA/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Examinations The OCC conducts regular examinations of national banks, federal savings associations, federal branches, and agencies of foreign banks in the U.S. to determine compliance with the BSA. BSA & Related Regulations The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 USC 5311 et seq establishes program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for national banks, federal savings associations, federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. The OCC's implementing regulations are found at 12 CFR 21.11 and 12 CFR 21.21. The BSA was amended to incorporate the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act which requires every bank to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program. BSA Law Enforcement Tools and Resources In addition to utilizing information filed by banks in money laundering and terrorist financing investigations, U.S. law enforcement also provides banks with access to resources and tools such as those listed here that can be used to strengthen your BSA/AML risk management programs. BSA/AML Bulletins, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Advisories, & Related BASEL Information The OCC and the U.S. Department of Treasury periodically issue alerts, advisories and rulemakings concerning institutions or individuals who may be engaged in fraudulent activities or be deemed to be of high-risk for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. BSA/AML Innovative Industry Approaches & Other Related Links The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the National Credit Union Administration issued a statement encouraging banks to take innovative approaches to meet their Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) compliance obligations and further strengthen the financial system against illicit financial activity. Counter-Terrorist Financing U.S. banks play a key role in combating the financing of terrorism by identifying and reporting potentially suspicious activity as required under the BSA. A number of resources are available to assist you in this effort. Money Laundering Criminals have long used money-laundering schemes to conceal or ""clean"" the source of fraudulently obtained or stolen funds. Money laundering poses significant risks to the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial industry. With the advent of terrorists who employ money-laundering techniques to fund their operations, the risk expands to encompass the safety and security of the nation. Through sound operations, banks play an important role in helping investigative and regulatory agencies identify money-laundering entities and take appropriate action. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and related anti-money laundering laws, banks must Establish effective BSA compliance programs Establish effective customer due diligence systems and monitoring programs Screen against Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and other government lists Establish an effective suspicious activity monitoring and reporting process Develop risk-based anti-money laundering programs Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) As of April 1, 2013, financial institutions must use the Bank Secrecy Act BSA E-Filing System in order to submit Suspicious Activity Reports. A financial institution is required to file a suspicious activity report no later than 30 calendar days after the date of initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a suspicious activity report. If no suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident requiring the filing, a financial institution may delay filing a suspicious activity report for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), financial institutions are required to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering, such as: Keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, File reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and Report suspicious activity that might signal criminal activity (e.g., money laundering, tax evasion) An amendment to the BSA incorporates provisions of the USA Patriot Act, which requires every bank to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program.

The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. The OCC does not have any enforcement actions against banks to release in September. The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term âinstitution-affiliated party,â or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs: Order of Prohibition against Armando De Leon, former Store Manager at a Hialeah, Florida, branch of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, based on the OCCâs uncontested allegations in the Notice of Charges that, among other things, De Leon submitted fraudulent Payment Protection Program (PPP) loan applications, received over $80,000 in PPP loan proceeds, and used the funds for personal gain. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-35) Order of Prohibition against Carolyn H. Hicks, former Bank Operations Assistant Manager at a Columbus, Georgia, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for misappropriating approximately $25,000 from a bank ATM. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-43) Order of Prohibition against Charron Meadows, former Team Manager at a Mount Laurel, New Jersey, call center of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for misappropriating at least $150,000 from the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-41) Order of Prohibition against Gerald E. Milligan II, former Teller at a Royal Palm, Florida, branch of PNC Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, based on the OCCâs uncontested allegations in the Notice of Charges that, among other things, Milligan knowingly made false attestations and provided false supporting documentation for a PPP loan application, received PPP loan proceeds in the amount of $141,530, and used the funds for personal gain. (Docket No. AA-EC-2024-12) Order of Prohibition against Walther Riano-Vanegas, former Teller at a Linden, New Jersey, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for stealing $15,670 from two ATMs at the branch. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-40) The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed ânot in complianceâ have become outdated or irrelevant to the bankâs current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed ânot in complianceâ into a new action. Termination actions include: Order Terminating the Cease and Desist Order against Gateway Bank, F.S.B., Oakland, California, dated November 12, 2020 (Docket No. AA-ENF-2020-69). The terminated order addressed unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to board and management supervision, internal audit, credit administration, and consumer compliance management, and for unsafe or unsound practices and violations of law related to the bankâs Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-47) Order Terminating the Cease and Desist Order against Vast Bank, N.A., Tulsa, Oklahoma, dated October 23, 2023 (Docket No. AA-SO-2023-44). The terminated order addressed unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to capital, capital and strategic planning, project management, books and records, liquidity risk management, interest rate risk management, information technology controls, risk management for new products, and custody account controls.

Removal of reputation risk references is identified by a strikethrough. Refer to OCC Bulletin 2025-4. Summary The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is issuing this bulletin to inform national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies (collectively, banks) of sound fraud risk management principles. This bulletin supplements other OCC and interagency issuances on corporate and risk governance, including the references listed in appendix A of this bulletin. Note for Community Banks This guidance applies to all OCC-supervised banks. Highlights The risk management principles addressed in this bulletin include the following: A bank should have sound corporate governance practices that instill a corporate culture of ethical standards and promote employee accountability. A bank's risk management system should include policies, processes, personnel, and control systems to effectively identify, measure, monitor, and control fraud risk consistent with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile. A bank's risk management system and system of internal controls should be designed to prevent and detect fraud. appropriately respond to fraud, suspected fraud, or allegations of fraud. Bank management should assess the likelihood and impact of potential fraud schemes and use the results of this assessment to inform the design of the bank's risk management system. Senior management and the board of directors should measure, monitor, and understand fraud losses across the enterprise and employ tools that appropriately quantify and assess loss experience and exposure. Control reviews and audits should include fraud risk as part of their assessments. Fraud risk management principles can be implemented in a variety of ways and may not always be structured within a formal fraud risk management program. Regardless of the structure, fraud risk management should be commensurate with the bank's risk profile. Banks with significant and far-reaching retail-oriented business activities should have well-documented fraud risk management programs with appropriate monitoring, measurements and reporting, and mitigation. Background Fraud may generally be characterized as an intentional act, misstatement, or omission designed to deceive others, resulting in the victim suffering a loss or the perpetrator achieving a gain.1 Fraud is typically categorized as internal or external. Internal fraud occurs when a director, an employee, a former employee, or a third party engaged by the bank commits fraud, colludes to commit fraud, or otherwise enables or contributes to fraud. External fraud consists of first-party fraud and victim fraud. External fraud is committed by a person or entity that is not a bank employee, a former employee, or a third party engaged by the bank. First-party fraud occurs when an external party, including a bank customer, commits fraud against the bank. Victim fraud occurs when a bank customer or client is the victim of an intentional fraudulent act. Fraud schemes are often ongoing crimes that can go undetected for months or even years and can be time consuming and costly to address. It is often difficult to fully understand and quantify the extent of the fraud and the harm caused. Measuring losses associated with fraud is often an inexact process. Typically, the true cost of fraud is greater than the direct financial loss, given the time and expense to investigate, loss of productivity, potential legal and compliance costs associated with remediation, and impact on a bank's reputation. Fraud risk is a form of operational risk, which is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events.2 Operational risk management weaknesses can result in heightened exposure to fraudulent activities, which can increase a bank's exposure to reputation and strategic risks. Failure to maintain an appropriate risk management system could expose the bank to the risk of significant fraud, defalcation (e.g., misappropriation of funds by an employee), and other operational losses. Governance Strong governance is of paramount importance to controlling the bank's exposure to fraud, and a strong corporate culture against fraud is crucial regardless of a bank's size or complexity. The tone at the top sets the foundation on which the bank operates. The board and senior management have a responsibility to lead by example and demonstrate that the bank is serious about promoting ethical behavior to deter and prevent fraud. The board-adopted code of ethics (or code of conduct) should encourage the timely communication and escalation of suspected fraud through the appropriate oversight channel. The board is ultimately responsible for oversight but may delegate fraud risk management-related duties to specific committees (for example, the audit committee or operational risk management committee). The board also may delegate anti-fraud responsibilities to specific executives and managers, including those in charge of managing risks and controls. Roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined. The board should hold management accountable for effective fraud risk management and alignment of anti-fraud efforts with the bank's strategy, objectives, risk appetite, and operational plans. While not all fraud can be avoided, an active board can foster an environment in which fraud is more likely to be prevented, deterred, and promptly detected. A sound corporate culture should discourage imprudent risk-taking. Incentives or requirements for employees to meet sales goals, financial performance goals, and other business goals, particularly if such goals are aggressive, can result in heightened fraud risk.3 Risk Management Sound fraud risk management principles should be integrated within the bank's risk management system commensurate with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile. Bank management should periodically assess the likelihood and impact of potential fraud schemes and use the documented results of this assessment to inform the design of the bank's risk management system and evaluate fraud control activities. Policies should clearly define, establish, and communicate the board's and senior management's commitment to fraud risk management. Processes should be designed to anticipate fraud and deploy a combination of preventive controls and detective controls. Detective controls are important because even with strong governance and oversight, collusion or circumvention of internal controls can allow fraud to occur. Some practices and controls may be both preventive and detective in nature. Preventive controls are designed to deter fraud or minimize its likelihood. The following are some examples: Policies and processes (e.g., ethics policies, code of conduct, identity theft program,4 and elder abuse policies) Anti-fraud awareness campaigns for board, senior management, staff, and third parties Fraud risk management training for employees and contractors commensurate with roles and responsibilities Customer education on fraud risks and preventive measures customers can take to reduce the risk of becoming victims System controls designed to prevent employees, agents, third parties, and others from conducting fraudulent transactions, performing inappropriate manual overrides, or manipulating financial reporting Controls to prevent fraudulent account opening, closing, or transactions Dual controls (e.g., over monetary instruments, accounting, customer transactions, and reporting) Segregation of duties Background investigations for new employees and periodic checks for existing employees and third parties Training customer-facing employees to identify potential victim fraud Sound information security programs5 Job breaks, such as mandatory consecutive two-week vacations or rotation of duties Customer identification program procedures, customer due diligence processes, and beneficial ownership identification and verification6 Real-time transaction analysis and behavioral analytics Detective controls are designed to identify and respond to fraud after it has occurred. The following are some examples: Models, monitoring systems, or reports designed to detect fraudulent activity across all lines of business and functions (e.g., exception reports, unusual card activity, unauthorized transactions, file maintenance reports, fee waiver analysis, and employee surveillance processes [account monitoring, system access patterns, and overrides]) Data analytics (e.g., loss data analysis, transactions, fee waivers, interest forgiven, charge-offs, errors, and consumer complaint data) Effective complaint resolution processes7 Monitoring and analysis of civil and criminal subpoenas received by the bank or information requests under section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act8 Monitoring and analysis of Bank Secrecy Act report filings by the bank and its affiliates Monitoring of news and other information concerning civil and criminal lawsuits Ethics and whistleblower reporting channels or hotlines Exit interviews for departing employees Software and technology tools, developed internally or purchased from a third party, can assist with anti-fraud efforts. Bank management should consider the cost and value of fraud prevention tools selected, consistent with the bank's overall strategy, complexity, and risk profile. Depending on the specific products and services offered, management might deploy solutions that serve to detect anomalies and prevent potential fraudulent transactions or activities. These solutions can monitor transactions and behaviors, employ layered or multifactor authentication, monitor networks for intrusions or malware, analyze transactions on internal bank platforms, and compare data with consortium or publicly available data. Banks' fraud prevention and detection tools should evolve and adapt to remain effective against emerging fraud types. Fraud Risk Measurement and Monitoring Senior management should understand the bank's exposure to fraud risk and associated losses across all business lines and functions and use this information to effectively monitor and manage fraud risk. The board should receive regular reporting on the bank's fraud risk assessment, resulting exposure to fraud risk, and associated losses to enable directors to understand the bank's fraud risk profile. Reporting should allow management and directors to measure performance. Practices can include benchmarking current fraud losses against loss history or industry data. Examples of metrics and analysis banks can use to measure and monitor fraud risk include the following: Metrics by fraud type (e.g., internal, external, loan, card, account opening, check, or embezzlement) Fraud losses (e.g., per open account, closed account, or litigation) Fraud recoveries Net fraud losses Fraud loss budget variance Automated clearing house return rates Percentage of customers claiming victim fraud Fraud control performance and control testing results Trend analysis of data such as number and dollar of fraud investigations customer complaints Bank Secrecy Act report metrics (e.g., Suspicious Activity Report [SAR] filings) civil and criminal subpoenas information requests under section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act Management should identify fraud losses as internal or external. Larger, more complex banks generally maintain this information in an operational loss database or similar system.9 Fraud Response, Reporting, and Information Sharing A bank's policies, processes, and control systems should prompt appropriate and timely investigations into, responses to, and reporting of suspected and confirmed fraud. Banks should have processes for internal investigations, law enforcement referrals, regulatory notifications,10 and reporting. A bank is required to file a SAR for known or suspected fraud meeting regulatory thresholds.11 Reporting mechanisms should relay relevant, accurate, and timely fraud-related information from all lines of business to appropriate oversight channels. Sound fraud risk management processes can include voluntary sharing of information with other financial institutions under section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act. Pursuant to section 314(b), before exchanging information, the bank must register with the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Current section 314(b) participants may share information with one another regarding individuals, entities, organizations, and countries for purposes of identifying and, when appropriate, reporting activities that may involve possible specified unlawful activities. FinCEN has issued guidance clarifying that, if section 314(b) participants suspect that transactions may involve the proceeds of specified unlawful activities, such as fraud, under the money laundering statutes,12 information related to such transactions can be shared under the protection of the section 314(b) safe harbor.13 Reviews and Audits A bank should design and perform reviews and audits specific to the bank's size, complexity, organizational structure, and risk profile. Reviews and audits should be designed to assess the effectiveness of the bank's internal controls and fraud risk management. Effective internal and external audit programs are a critical defense against fraud and provide vital information to the board of directors about the effectiveness of internal control systems. Reviews and audits typically include the following:14 Quality assurance and quality control reviews Independent risk management reviews Internal and external audits Retrospective reviews after fraud is identified Third-party relationship audits (or audit reports) consistent with contractual provisions When auditing financial statements and asserting effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, auditors must consider a material misstatement due to fraud.15 If the auditor identifies that fraud may be present, the auditor must discuss these findings with the board or management in a timely fashion.16 The auditor must also determine whether they have a responsibility to report the suspected fraud to the OCC.17 Findings and results from audits and reviews should be communicated to the relevant parties in a timely manner.

This bulletin does not address other risks, such as interest rate risk.2 Recission This bulletin rescinds Banking Bulletin 1993-50, âLoan Refinancing.â Note for Community Banks This bulletin applies to all banks with commercial loans. Highlights This bulletin discusses the effect of refinance risk on credit risk in commercial loan transactions and portfolios. provides guidance on transaction and portfolio-level refinance risk management. Background Refinance risk is the risk that borrowers will not be able to replace existing debt at a future date under reasonable terms and prevailing market conditions. Refinance risk increases in rising interest rate environments and can be amplified by large volumes of loans set to mature in underperforming markets.3 If a borrower cannot refinance under current market conditions, a bank could be burdened with an underperforming or nonperforming loan. Refinance risk primarily affects loans with principal balances remaining at maturity and borrowers who rely on recurring debt to finance their capital structure or business operations. Examples of loan types most affected by refinance risk include interest-only loans, commercial real estate loans,4 leveraged loans, and revolving working capital lines. Fully amortizing loans to sound borrowers generally have lower refinance risk than loans that are not fully amortizing. Refinance risk affects individual loans and portfolios of loans. A concentration in such loans could increase the cost and complexity of problem loan resolutions when borrowers are under stress. In addition, if a significant volume or amount of loans refinance during adverse economic conditions, it could constrain a bankâs capital or liquidity, threaten earnings, or hinder strategic initiatives.5 Refinance risk can be driven by external factors or borrower-specific factors. External factors that affect refinance risk include investor risk appetite and market liquidity; the current interest rate environment; inflation; or supply chain effects on the costs of goods, services, or labor. Refinance risk increases in rising interest rate environments because borrowers may be unable to service their debt at higher interest rates upon refinance. Refinance risk may also increase for some borrowers or portfolios because of declining industry fundamentals or changes in commodity prices. Borrower-specific drivers for heightened refinance risk include high leverage, constrained liquidity, a significant volume of near-term maturities, poor financial performance, or unpopular market sentiment. Guidance Banks should have processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control refinance risk at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The tools to monitor refinance risk should be tailored to the bankâs size, complexity, risk profile, and types of lending. Sound transaction-level credit risk management practices include assessing refinance risk at underwriting, during ongoing monitoring, and near maturity. At the portfolio level, banks should have systems and processes to monitor the volume and cadence of upcoming loan maturities. Independent credit risk review should consider the level of refinance risk when determining an appropriate review scope and assessing credit quality.6 One common method to assess refinance risk at the transaction and portfolio level is multivariable stress testing. Transaction-level stress testing can provide insight into the borrowerâs ability to meet refinancing requirements if the borrowerâs financial condition declines or market conditions deteriorate (e.g., interest rates increase, market terms tighten, expenses increase, or collateral values fall). Portfolio-level stress testing can identify and measure the potential effect of changing market conditions on portfolio segments with higher refinance risk.7 Transaction-Level Risk Management and Risk-Rating Considerations Banks should evaluate refinance risk when approving and structuring loans, during ongoing monitoring (e.g., annual reviews), near loan maturity, and when considering granting extensions or renewals. Refinance risk can also be a factor when risk-rating a loan. A prudent assessment of refinance risk includes a borrowerâs refinancing needs, the performance of the underlying project or asset, the timing of a refinancing transaction (e.g., maturity), the amount and maturity dates of other debt, current market liquidity, and the cost of refinancing. At origination, banks can structure a loan to mitigate refinance risk. For example, underwriting standards may include debt service coverage or loan-to-value requirements that provide a cushion if a borrowerâs financial condition declines or market conditions deteriorate. Banks may also require covenants that preserve the borrowerâs ability to refinance (e.g., leverage covenants or limits on incremental debt) or trigger action before maturity to protect the bank (e.g., debt service coverage ratios or liquidity ratios). During ongoing monitoring and near maturity, management should conduct analysis to determine the borrowerâs refinance requirements and ability to reasonably qualify for another market rate loan to cover the projected outstanding principal. The analysis can also provide insight into the likelihood that a borrower might seek refinancing prior to maturity (e.g., to support significant business expansion, because of a leveraged buyout, or to pay out a retiring partner). Effective analysis of refinance risk includes a loanâs performance compared with expectations at underwriting, the time horizon for a refinance event, borrower-specific factors, and external factors. Analysis should include determining whether a borrower can meet current underwriting standards, including prevailing interest rates, for similar loans. Banks should have refinance plans in place for borrowers with near-term refinancing needs. While market demand could affect a borrowerâs ability to refinance, generally the stronger a borrowerâs underlying financial performance, the more refinance options are available. For loans maturing with an outstanding principal balance or otherwise likely to require near-term refinancing, credit risk ratings should take into account the likelihood that the borrower will be able to obtain refinancing without relying on distressed terms. Refinance risk is just one consideration in determining an appropriate risk rating and should be evaluated in the context of the borrowerâs overall financial condition and debt service ability. While increased refinance risk does not automatically warrant a change in a loanâs risk rating, classification is appropriate when there are well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize repayment. Loans that are adequately protected by the current sound worth and debt service ability of the borrower, guarantor, or the underlying collateral8 generally are not adversely classified.9 Similarly, loans to sound borrowers that are modified in accordance with prudent underwriting standards are generally not adversely classified unless well-defined weaknesses exist that jeopardize repayment. Such loans, however, could be flagged for managementâs attention or for inclusion in designated âwatch lists.â Portfolio-Level Analysis and Risk Management Banks should have processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control refinance risk at the portfolio level. Assessing refinance risk at the portfolio level allows a bank to identify borrowers experiencing similar stresses, whether macroeconomic or specific to an industry or region. Effective processes generally include the ability to identify and monitor the volume and amount of loans maturing with outstanding principal balances and portfolio segments affected by external risk factors. stress-testing to identify portfolios with heightened refinance risk. limits that reflect the bankâs risk appetite. reporting that monitors the level of refinance risk and performance relative to established limits. A bank can mitigate refinance risk by establishing criteria that define when it is appropriate to underwrite loans that will not fully amortize by maturity (e.g., interest-only loans, loans with balloon payments, or revolving loans) and prudent terms for such loans (e.g., re-margining requirements, covenants, or cleanup requirements). Underwriting criteria can also detail the prudent use of interest rate swaps and caps. Banks can further mitigate refinance risk by setting appropriate underwriting exception limits, controls, and reporting (e.g., limiting loans underwritten with covenant-lite structures or with marginal debt service coverage or loan-to-value ratios). Setting and adhering to concentration limits can protect the balance sheet from potential refinancing shocks and bank capital from outsized losses when refinance options are limited. Refinance risk can occur across different lending products, and it is prudent for management to consider whether refinance risk creates correlated exposures not otherwise identified, especially during a deteriorating economic environment.10 Loans Restructured Under a Prudent Loan Workout Plan The OCC encourages banks to work proactively and prudently with borrowers who are, or may be, unable to meet their contractual payment obligations during periods of financial stress. An effective loan workout arrangement should improve the bankâs prospects for repayment of principal and interest, be consistent with sound banking and accounting practices, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.11 Management should consider refinance risk when developing an effective workout strategy. In some cases, as part of a prudent workout plan, a loan originally underwritten with fully amortizing terms is restructured with an outstanding principal payment at maturity. Management should appropriately risk-rate and manage such loans. Management should also measure and monitor the volume of modified and restructured loans. When assessing refinance risk at the portfolio level, management should consider the volume of modified or restructured loans that will no longer fully amortize by maturity. If management determines that a loan refinance represents a modification or accommodation to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty,12 management should perform further analysis to determine whether the loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans and should be reviewed individually when determining an appropriate allowance for credit loss. Management should also determine whether the loan is collateral-dependent.13 Further Information Please contact Barry Mills, Director for Commercial Credit Risk Policy, at (202) 649-6220. Grovetta N.

For more information specific to commercial real estate lending, refer to the âCommercial Real Estate Lendingâ booklet of the Comptrollerâs Handbook. 5 Refinance risk can affect a bankâs interest rate risk when a material amount of loans on the balance sheet with higher levels of refinance risk mature at the same time or within a tight time frame. Loans that are unable to refinance at market terms could result in an unplanned asset/liability price mismatch on a bankâs balance sheet. 6 For more information about credit risk review, refer to OCC Bulletin 2020-50, âCredit Risk: Interagency Guidance on Credit Risk Review Systems.â 7 For more information on stress testing, refer to OCC Bulletin 2012-33, âCommunity Bank Stress Testing: Supervisory Guidance,â and OCC Bulletin 2012-14, âStress Testing: Interagency Stress Testing Guidance.â 8 Collateral value alone is not sufficient to preclude adverse classification when well-defined weaknesses are present.

The rule allows these organizations to use asset data as of December 31, 2019, to determine the applicability of various regulatory asset thresholds during calendar years 2020 and 2021. The OCC also intends to provide similar flexibility to community banking organizations crossing other thresholds in OCC regulations that are not specifically addressed in this rule. Note for Community Banks The rule applies to community banks with total assets of less than $10 billion as of December 31, 2019. Highlights Community banking organizations have played an instrumental role in the nationâs financial response to COVID-19, and many have experienced significant balance-sheet growth as a result of the pandemic and the policy response to it. Much of this growth, particularly that related to participation in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), is expected to be temporary. Community banking organizations are subject to a wide range of statutory requirements, regulations, and reporting requirements predicated on their risk profile and asset size. Due to their response to COVID-19, many community banking organizations have been, or may soon be, pushed over an asset threshold that could subject them to additional regulation or to additional reporting requirements. This rule gives community banking organizations more time to either reduce their balance sheets by shedding temporary growth or prepare for higher regulatory and reporting standards. To provide this regulatory burden relief, the rule temporarily changes, for a number of asset-based regulatory thresholds, the date as of when a community banking organization measures its assets for the purpose of determining whether it exceeds a threshold. Specifically, the rule will permit community banking organizations, through December 31, 2021, to determine the applicability of certain asset-based regulatory thresholds using asset data as of December 31, 2019, if the organizationâs assets as of that date were less than its assets on the date as of which the applicability of a given threshold would normally be determined. This means that asset growth in 2020 or 2021 will not trigger new regulatory requirements for these community banking organizations until January 1, 2022, at the earliest. This temporary regulatory burden relief reflects that much of the asset growth since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially growth related to PPP lending, is generally expected to be temporary in nature and therefore likely does not reflect changes in community banking organizationsâ risk profiles. Specifically, the rule provides OCC-supervised institutions with temporary relief from the asset thresholds in the following rules: The $10 billion threshold in the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 12 CFR 3.12; The $10 billion threshold in the Boardâs debit card interchange fee regulation at 12 CFR 235.5; The $5 billion threshold for eligibility for reduced reporting requirements for the call report at 12 CFR 52.2; and The $3 billion threshold for eligibility for an 18-month examination cycle at 12 CFR 4.6(b) and 4.7(b).

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the EITC and its positive impact on Americaâs working families. The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit for low- to moderate-income households. The EITC can reduce the amount of taxes owed on a workerâs earned income and, in some cases, increase the workerâs refund. Millions of workers may be eligible for EITC for the first time based on changes to their financial situation or their marital or parental status. Families with children may receive a refund of up to $7,830. Banks can play an important role by informing customers about EITC and reminding them to review qualifications to determine eligibility, including: having an earned income under $66,819 in tax year 2024, depending on marital or parental status. having investment income below $11,600 in the tax year 2024. having a valid Social Security number by the due date of the 2024 return. being a U.S. citizen or a resident alien during the entire 2024 tax year. In addition to promoting EITC awareness, the OCC encourages banks and federal savings associations to: share information about the EITC with their customers and stakeholders using social media or customer email and mailing lists. provide and promote low-cost bank products and services that enable tax refund recipients to deposit their income tax refunds directly into their accounts. inform customers about ways to use tax refunds to pay down debt and build savings. sponsor IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs in branches and support employees who volunteer as tax preparers in low- to moderate-income communities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background
On October 30, 2023, after issuing separate requests for comment,1 the agencies jointly
issued Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management (principles).2 These
1 OCC Bulletin 2021-62, Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large
Banks; Request for Feedback, (December 16, 2021); FDIC, Request for Comment on a Statement of Principles for
Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, 87 FR 19507 (April 4, 2022); Board,
Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, 87 FR 75267
(December 8, 2022).
2 88 FR 74183 (October 30, 2023).
-2- principles were intended for financial institutions3 with over $100 billion in total consolidated
assets. On March 31, 2025, the OCC withdrew its participation in the principles.4
II. Rescission of Guidance
The agencies’ existing safety and soundness standards require all insured depository
institutions to have effective risk management processes commensurate with the size, complexity
and risk of their activities.5 In addition, financial institutions of all sizes are expected to consider
and appropriately address all material risks in their operating environment and should be resilient
to a range of risks, including emerging risks.6 The agencies do not believe principles for the
management of climate-related financial risk are necessary and are concerned that such
principles could distract from the management of other potential risks identified and addressed
by financial institutions’ existing risk management processes and the agencies’ other risk
management rules and guidance. 7 Therefore, the principles are rescinded.
III.Administrative Law Matters
3 In this issuance, the term “financial institution” or “institution” includes national banks, Federal savings
associations, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, state nonmember banks, state savings associations, state
member banks, bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, intermediate holding companies,
foreign banking organizations with respect to their U.S. operations, and non-bank systemically important financial
institutions (SIFIs) supervised by the Board.
4 OCC Withdraws Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, News
Release 2025-27 (March 31, 2025).
5 Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, requires the FDIC, Board, and OCC to
prescribe safety and soundness standards for insured depository institutions. Such standards were implemented by
rule in 12 CFR part 364, appendix A (FDIC), 12 CFR part 208, appendix D-1 (Board), and 12 CFR part 30,
appendix A (OCC). These guidelines address, among other things, operational and managerial standards relating to
(1)internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit
underwriting; and (4) interest rate risk exposure.

7 Neither the principles nor this rescission requires or prohibits financial institutions’ consideration of any particular
risk or set of risks, nor do they create any rights or obligations for financial institutions.
-3- A.Executive Order 12866
Pursuant to section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that the
rescission is a “significant regulatory action.”
B.Paperwork Reduction Act
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) (PRA) states that no
agency may conduct or sponsor, nor is the respondent required to respond to, an information
collection unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
The rescission does not create any new, or revise any existing, collections of information
under the PRA. Therefore, no information collection request will be submitted to the OMB for
review.

Community banks are still expected to follow all laws and regulations applicable to their RNDIP offerings and comply with all pertinent legal requirements. Note for Community Banks This guidance is applicable to all community banks. Highlights Many banks recommend or sell RNDIPs either to retail customers directly or more commonly through arrangements with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. The OCC has published guidance to examiners regarding the examination of bank RNDIP programs in the RNDIP booklet of the Comptroller's Handbook. The RNDIP booklet defines RNDIPs to include any product with an investment component that, in most instances, is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Common RNDIPs include mutual funds, exchange traded funds, variable and fixed rate annuities, equities, and fixed income securities. The RNDIP booklet provides comprehensive guidance for bank examiners on activities involving the recommendation or sale of RNDIPs to retail customers, explains the risks inherent in banks' RNDIP sales programs, and provides a framework for banks to manage those risks. This booklet provides expanded examination procedures for evaluating banks' RNDIP sales activities that supplement the core assessment standards in the ""Large Bank Supervision"" and ""Community Bank Supervision"" booklets of the Comptroller's Handbook. Because of their complexity, the comprehensive exam procedures and risk management practices outlined in the RNDIP booklet are generally unsuitable for community banks. As a result, these procedures and practices impose unnecessary burden. The OCC makes judicious use of its exam resources and prioritizes its examinations around the most salient risks to its banks. Examining community banks according to the expanded procedures in the RNDIP booklet is not a prudent use of OCC examination resources. Community banks tend to have more limited RNDIP offerings. Thus, under the OCC's risk-based examination posture, a simpler examination framework is appropriate for them. Relieving unnecessary examination burden from the RNDIP programs will leave community banks with more resources to focus on material financial risk mitigation. Removing unnecessary impediments to community banks' offering of RNDIP sales programs can promote the competitive viability of community banks and the availability of beneficial financial services to consumers. The OCC will no longer examine community banks' direct or indirect offering of RNDIP products using the standards and procedures in the RNDIP booklet. Instead, OCC examiners will only use the core assessment standards in the ""Community Bank Supervision"" booklet of the Comptroller's Handbook. This change to examination policy is part of the OCC's ongoing efforts to reflect a tailored regulatory framework for bank supervision. Community banks must comply with all laws and regulations applicable to their direct or indirect offering of RNDIP products and activities, including: the GrammâLeachâBliley Act, federal securities laws, federal and state insurance laws, consumer privacy laws, Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering laws, and prudential OCC regulations. The OCC will continue to consider each bank's RNDIP activities on an individual basis and will continue to consider each bank's unique circumstances and risk profile when determining examination priorities for that institution. The OCC will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the procedures and expectations in the RNDIP booklet and will consider making further edits to the booklet in the future consistent with safety and soundness principles to reduce burden for a wider range of banks.

This approach will maintain the value of the federal charter and preserve banksâ safety and soundness while ensuring regulatory oversight does not unduly distract banks from serving their communities. The OCC will continue to review its examination processes and will update the relevant booklets of the Comptrollerâs Handbook and other documents as soon as practicable. Note for Community Banks This guidance is applicable to all community banks. Highlights Effective January 1, 2026, the OCC is eliminating mandatory OCC policy-based examination requirements for community banks to reduce supervisory burden and better align OCC practices with risk-based supervision. Bank examiners will be empowered to tailor examination scope and frequency based on risk-based supervision, consistent with applicable laws and regulations. The OCC is reaffirming the importance of examinersâ relying on quarterly monitoring and existing bank reports. The OCC is also reassessing its data collection requests. Background The OCC recognizes the vital role that community banks serve in meeting the needs of their communities. Most community banks are well capitalized and well managed, conduct business in a safe and sound manner, and engage in low-risk activities. The OCC is required by statute and regulation to conduct a full scope, on site examination of every bank every 12 to 18 months, in what is referred to as the supervisory cycle.2 In implementing this requirement and fulfilling its mission in ensuring the safe and sound operation of banks under its supervision, the OCC has long strived to apply risk-based supervision in its examination of banks of all sizes.3 However, in practice, the OCC has continued to require certain examination activities with predefined scope and frequency set by OCC policy. The OCC is reaffirming its commitment to risk-based supervision, and it will tailor its supervisory activities for community banks to each bankâs size, complexity, and risk profile. To align with risk-based supervision, effective January 1, 2026, the OCC is removing for community banks all requirements for examination activities set by OCC policy. Instead, in fulfilling its responsibility for conducting a full scope, on-site examination during each supervisory cycle, OCC examiners will tailor their examination of a community bankâs specific activities in light of its size, complexity, and risk profile, with heightened focus on material financial risks. Examiners will retain their discretion to conduct, as appropriate, supervisory activities beyond those required by statute, consistent with a bankâs size, complexity, risk profile, and the risks posed by the bankâs specific activities. This change will reduce regulatory burden on community banks and simplify requests made by examiners. For example, OCC policy currently requires examiners to perform a fair lending risk assessment during every supervisory cycle and perform transaction testing for flood insurance coverage once during every three supervisory cycles.4 (Refer to the appendix to this bulletin for a table of OCC examination and activities set by policy.) By eliminating these requirements, examiners will no longer be required to collect information or perform these activities. Similarly, in examining a bankâs compliance with flood insurance requirements, examiners will determine whether there is a need to conduct transaction testing based on risk and will not, for example, conduct transaction testing solely for the sake of completing procedures required by OCC policy. When appropriate for a community bankâs activities and risk profile, examiners will conduct appropriate examination activities. This may include streamlined testing methods, more limited sampling, and reliance on bank-provided reports as appropriate for a community bankâs activities and size, complexity, and risk profile. As needed, examiners will also conduct follow up activities for matters requiring attention, violations of law, and enforcement actions at appropriate times. The OCC is also reaffirming the importance of examiners relying on quarterly monitoring activities5 and bank-provided reports. As part of their quarterly monitoring, examiners will conduct off-site analyses focused on essential financial risk indicators. Examiners will discuss with bank management financial trends and changes in bank operations, risk management, and personnel. Examiners will focus on areas of significant actual or planned changes, including growth, to determine whether there are emerging or newly identified risks. Examiners will use this analysis and communication to better focus on actual risks facing the bank and reduce disruption during the required on-site examination. Similarly, examiners will leverage a community bankâs audit, risk management, reporting and other functions when appropriate. Although examiners will need to determine the reliability of these functions, when reliance is appropriate, examiners will use these bank-provided reports to avoid unnecessary duplication and reduce the burden on banks. The OCC is also reassessing its data-collection activities for community banks. For example, the OCC currently collects information from community banks such as the Money Laundering Risk System and the Interest Rate Risk Survey to assist in scoping examinations. The OCC is assessing its use of these tools and whether the data collected are necessary or could be collected in a less burdensome manner. The OCC will continue to review its processes to identify additional opportunities to gain efficiencies and provide relief from regulatory burden. The OCC will communicate any further changes and update the booklets of the Comptrollerâs Handbook and other documents as applicable.

Concurrently, the OCC has instructed its examiners that they should no longer examine for disparate impact. Note for Community Banks The OCC's discontinuation of examining for disparate impact applies to community banks. Highlights On April 23, 2025, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 14281, Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy. EO 14281 directs agencies to eliminate the use of disparate impact liability in all contexts. Consistent with EO 14281, the OCC supervisory process for fair lending compliance no longer includes examining for disparate impact liability. Examiners will not request, review, or conclude on or follow-up on matters related to a bank's disparate impact risk, internal disparate-impact risk analysis, or disparate-impact risk assessment processes or procedures. The OCC's supervisory processes continue to include regularly conducting fair lending risk assessments, analyzing Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data for possible evidence of disparate treatment, conducting risk-based fair lending examinations, and taking appropriate action if evidence of disparate treatment is found. The OCC expects banks to provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found at https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations. Lending: The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty should be accounted for as a new loan or a continuance of an existing loan. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and appropriately report the modification in the institutionâs call report. In supervising institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by the California wildfires and straight-line winds may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agenciesâ reporting requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agenciesâ regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agenciesâ staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institutionâs particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm. Investments: Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.
