and distrust that can emanate from seemingly small but repeated acts of fraud.8
As with many collective action problems, public-private partnerships can be effective.
For instance, coordination and information-sharing efforts focused on cyber risks provide a
useful model for consideration. At the OCC, we are focused on supporting and encouraging these
and other collaborative fraud education and fraud prevention efforts. In addition, we are
regularly engaging with our partners in interagency and international efforts to strengthen
regulatory and supervisory responses to financial fraud. This includes participating in various
working groups with representatives from industry, financial regulators, and law enforcement.
Banks and bank regulators can and will need to do more to address fraud. But they cannot
solve the problem on their own. Social media platforms, telecommunication companies, email
hosts, the U.S. Postal Service, and law enforcement need to step up and do their part as well to
keep the proverbial streets clean, safe, and trusted. The OCC looks forward to continued and
enhanced collaboration with all stakeholders to address this important issue.

For purposes of the request for information, payments fraud generally refers to the use of illegal means to make or receive payments for personal gain, including scams. Because payments fraud may involve multiple institutions and payment methods, no single agency or private-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. Therefore, the agencies are seeking public comment on discrete actions, collectively or independently, to mitigate payments fraud, including check fraud, within their respective bank regulation and payments authorities. Input is requested on five potential areas for improvement and collaboration: External collaboration among the agencies, Federal Reserve Banks, and industry stakeholders; Consumer, business, and industry education by the agencies and Federal Reserve Banks to educate about payments fraud; Regulation and supervision to mitigate payments fraud, including opportunities the Board may have related to check fraud; Payments fraud data collection and information sharing; and Federal Reserve Banksâ operator tools and services to reduce payments fraud. In addition to seeking public input, the agencies will also continue looking for additional opportunities to effectively collaborate across other state and federal agencies given the importance of interagency coordination to help mitigate payments fraud. Comments must be received within 90 days after date of publication in the Federal Register.

How It Works Check fraud occurs when an unauthorized person uses someone elseâs checks, or images of a check, to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals. Common Methods of Check Fraud Check fraud: Scammers steal, or forge checks to make unauthorized transactions. Check washing: Fraudsters alter or âwashâ legitimate checks with chemicals to erase the ink from a check to rewrite amounts and payees. Mail fraud: Defrauding others by sending or receiving fraudulent checks through the mail. Warning Signs Unfamiliar checking account transactions appear on your bank statements. Your bank notifies you of unauthorized account activity. You receive calls from your bank about checks you didnât write or transactions you didnât make. Someone unsolicited contacts you with a request to deposit a check for any reason, especially to make money on a limited time offer of any kind. You receive a check in the mail related to employment as a mystery shopper, personal assistant, or for being the winner of a prize. Ways to Avoid It Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Set up account alerts for all transactions and review your statements frequently for unauthorized charges or unusual and suspicious activity. Use black gel ink on checks: Black gel ink is highly resistant to check washing, a common scheme where chemicals are used to erase ink from a check to rewrite amounts and payees. Get mail promptly after delivery and avoid leaving mail in your mailbox overnight. When sending checks, consider using the letter slots in your post office to send mail. Be wary of sending money or any medium of payment to someone after taking a check from them for any reason. Scammers often claim overpayment or demand you send or wire money after they give you a bad check. Ways to Report It Taking prompt and comprehensive action when faced with check fraud can help mitigate any potential damage and ensure that the fraudulent charges are resolved effectively. Notify your financial institution Bank: Inform your bank about the fraudulent transaction. Dispute any unauthorized charges and consider requesting your account be closed and a new account opened. Report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Online: Submit a complaint to the IC3, a division of the FBI. This is especially useful for internet-related crimes. Report the fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Online: Visit the FTCâs IdentityTheft.gov to report the theft and create a recovery plan. Phone: Call the FTC at 1-877-438-4338. U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS): For mail-related scams. Online: uspis.gov Phone: 1-877-876-2455 File a report with law enforcement Local law enforcement: Visit or contact your local law enforcement agency to file a report about the fraud.

How It Works Consumer product and retail fraud involves scams related to the purchase and sale of goods. Fraudsters might sell counterfeit goods or use fake retail sites to steal money from consumers. Common Methods of Consumer Product and Retail Fraud Counterfeit goods: Selling fake or substandard products at high prices or selling high-end products at âtoo good to be trueâ prices. Online auction scams: Scammers lure buyers with fake auction listings and collect payment without delivering the item. Retail return fraud: Individuals use various deceptive methods such as a false identity to return products for a refund, store credit, or exchange. Warning Signs Deeply discounted products or offers that seem too good to be true. Sellers who request unusual payment methods, like wire transfers, gift cards, or cryptocurrency. Little to no information about the sellerâs company, including no return policy or contact details. Receiving counterfeit goods or items that donât match the advertised product description. Misleading advertising: False claims about a productâs capabilities or features. Non-delivery of goods: Payment made but no product received. Warranty and return scams: Issues with a productâs warranty or return policy deception. Ways to Avoid It Research sellers: Only buy from reputable retailers and read customer reviews before making purchases. Be skeptical of deals: If a deal seems too good to be true, it likely is. Avoid offers that promise unusually low prices. Review return policies: Ensure the seller has clear return and refund policies and avoid purchasing from sites that lack transparency. Ways to Report It Fraudsters use counterfeit goods, online auction scams, and retail return fraud to deceive consumers into paying for products they donât receive or that are of inferior quality. Contact the seller or manufacturer Customer service: Reach out to the seller or manufacturerâs customer service to report the issue and seek resolution. Return policy: If applicable, use the return or exchange policy. Report the fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Online: Visit ReportFraud.ftc.gov to report the fraud. Phone: Call the FTC at 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) if you prefer to file your complaint over the phone. Report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Online: Submit a complaint to the IC3, a division of the FBI. This is especially useful for internet-related crimes. Alert online retail platforms E-commerce sites: If the product was purchased online, report the issue directly through the platformâs customer support or complaint system.

How It Works Credit card and debit card fraud occurs when a person uses someone elseâs card or card information to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals. This can happen through physical theft of the card or by stealing card information online or through card skimming devices. Common Methods of Credit Card and Debit Card Fraud Account takeover: A fraudster takes control of a credit or debit card account to make unauthorized transactions. Card-not-present fraud: An unauthorized person uses stolen card details to make online purchases. Card skimming: Devices capture card information at ATMs or point-of-sale terminals, such as at gas pumps. Mail fraud: A scheme by a fraudster to intercept a credit or debit card from the mail before the intended account holder receives it. Phone thefts and fraud: Fraudsters target smartphones to access sensitive financial information, digital cards, banking apps, and wallets stored on the device. Warning Signs Unfamiliar credit or debit card transactions appear on your bank or credit card statements. Small dollar authorizations or transactions are used to âtestâ an account prior to much larger transaction activity. Your bank notifies you of unauthorized account activity. You receive calls from your bank about transactions you didnât make. Ways to Avoid It Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Set up account alerts for all transactions and review your statements frequently for unauthorized charges or unusual and suspicious activity. Use secure payment methods: When shopping online, ensure the website is secure (look for âhttpsâ in the URL) and avoid saving payment information on websites. Be cautious with ATMs and other point-of-sale terminals: Use ATMs located at secure, well-lit locations, and cover the keypad when entering your PIN to prevent skimming devices from capturing your information. Check if any parts of a point-of-sale terminal are loose or wiggle. Keep your cards secure: Never share your card details with anyone, and report lost or stolen cards immediately. Use strong passwords: Ensure all your online accounts have long, complex passwords and enable two-factor authentication where possible. Be sure all your online accounts have different passwords. Ways to Report It Taking prompt and comprehensive action when faced with credit card or debit card fraud can help mitigate any potential damage and ensure that the fraudulent charges are resolved effectively. Contact your card issuer immediately Phone: Call the customer service number found on the back of your credit or debit card or on the bankâs website. Report the fraudulent charges and request that your card be blocked or replaced. Online: Many financial institutions allow you to report fraud through their online banking or mobile app platforms. Consider requesting a new account. Place a fraud alert on your credit report Contact credit reporting agencies: Place a fraud alert on your credit reports by contacting one of the three major credit bureaus. The bureau you contact will inform the other two. Equifax: 1-800-525-6285 Experian: 1-888-397-3742 TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289 A fraud alert makes it harder for identity thieves to open accounts in your name. Duration: A fraud alert lasts for one year, but you can extend it. Report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Online: Submit a complaint to the IC3, a division of the FBI. This is especially useful for internet-related crimes. Report the fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Online: Visit the FTCâs IdentityTheft.gov to report the theft and create a recovery plan. Phone: Call the FTC at 1-877-438-4338.

Similar to imposter scams, this can involve fraudsters posing as government agents, such as the IRS, on uncollected debts. How It Works Debt collection fraud involves scammers impersonating legitimate debt collectors or creating fake debts to scare victims into paying money they donât owe. These fraudsters often use threats of legal action or arrest to force payments. Common Methods of Debt Collection Fraud Debt settlement scams: Fraudsters provide false promises to settle debts in exchange for upfront fees. Fake lawsuits or arrest claims: Fraudsters threaten consumers with lawsuits or arrest for unpaid debts to force payment. Phony debt collectors: Scammers demand immediate payment for fake or non-existent debts. Warning Signs Receiving calls or letters from debt collectors for debts you donât recognize or owe. Threats of arrest, legal action, or wage garnishment if payment isnât made immediately. Refusal by the caller to provide written verification of the debt. Demands for payment via wire transfers, prepaid cards, or gift cards. Ways to Avoid It Request written verification: Always ask for written proof of the debt from the lender or servicer before making any payments. Know your rights: Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), you are entitled to dispute a debt and request verification. Do not share personal information: Never provide sensitive information, like your Social Security number or bank details, to unsolicited callers. Ways to Report It Scammers pretend to be legitimate debt collectors, often attempting to collect on non-existent or fake debts using threats or intimidation so it is important to take action to mitigate any potential damage and ensure that the fraudsters are reported to the proper authorities. Report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Online: Submit a complaint to the IC3, a division of the FBI. This is especially useful for internet-related crimes. Report the fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Online: Visit ReportFraud.ftc.gov to report the fraud. Provide as many details as possible about the interaction.

How It Works Financial and investment fraud involves schemes that trick victims into investing money based on false information and/or promises. These scams often promise high returns with little or no risk, but victims end up losing their money. Common Methods of Financial and Investment Fraud Funnel accounts: Fraudsters use your bank account to transfer illicit funds, making you an unknowing participant in money laundering. Investment scams: Fraudsters build long-term relationships with victims to convince them to invest large sums in fake investment platforms. Fraudsters also refer to this scam as âpig butchering.â Ponzi and pyramid schemes: Scams that pay investors supposed profits on their investments by using the investments of new participants. Warning Signs Unsolicited investment offers promising high returns with little to no risk. Pressure to âact fastâ on an investment or miss out on a âonce-in-a-lifetimeâ opportunity. Requests to make investments using payment in unconventional forms, like wire transfers or cryptocurrencies. Lack of proper documentation, such as prospectuses or disclosure statements for investments. Ways to Avoid It Do your research before investing: Check with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or your stateâs securities regulator to verify the legitimacy of the person or firm involved in the investment opportunity. Be skeptical of guarantees: All investments carry some risk. Be suspicious of anyone promising guaranteed or unusually high returns. Avoid high-pressure tactics: A legitimate investment professional will give you time to consider the risks and wonât pressure you to act immediately. Monitor your financial accounts Regularly review your financial and investment accounts for any unusual or unauthorized transactions. Report any discrepancies immediately to your financial institution and the relevant authorities. Ways to Report It Taking immediate and comprehensive action can help mitigate the impact of financial and investment fraud. File a report with the SEC Online: File a complaint using the SECâs online form. Phone: Call the SECâs Office of Investor Education and Advocacy at 1-800-732-0330 for guidance on how to file your complaint. Report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Online: Submit a complaint to the IC3, a division of the FBI. This is especially useful for internet-related crimes. Alert your state securities regulator or attorney generalâs office Contact your stateâs securities regulator or attorney generalâs office for local assistance.

Fraudsters exploit the popularity of gift cards as convenient presents by tricking individuals into purchasing gift cards for fictitious reasons or stealing funds from purchased cards. These scams are particularly effective during the holiday rush, as people may be less vigilant and more likely to fall for high-pressure tactics or deals that appear time-sensitive. How It Works Scammers exploit the increased financial activity that occurs during the holiday season when consumers can be distracted to carry out a range of fraudulent schemes. Common Methods of Holiday and Gift Card Scams Delivery scams: Scammers may take advantage of increased package deliveries by sending fake notifications about undelivered packages to trick recipients into providing personal information or payment details. Gift card fraud: Scammers trick victims into paying for services or fines using gift cards, or they steal the balance from legitimate gift cards. Holiday shopping scams: Fake holiday sales or promotions lure consumers into making purchases from fraudulent websites, but the customer never receives their items. Phony charities: Fraudsters create fake charities during the holiday season to exploit peopleâs goodwill and collect donations that are never used for the stated cause. Seasonal employment scams: During the holiday season, many people seek temporary jobs in retail, delivery services, and other industries. Scammers exploit this demand by posting fake job listings. Victims are sometimes asked to provide personal information, pay upfront fees, or work without compensation. Travel scams: As people book holiday travel, scammers may offer fake travel deals, cheap flights, or holiday vacation packages. Victims may pay upfront, only to find the tickets or bookings do not exist. Warning Signs Requests for payment via gift cards for services or fines. No legitimate business or government agency will ask for payment in this form. Gift cards that appear to have been tampered with, such as torn packaging or scratched-off security codes. Unsolicited messages offering discounted or free gift cards. Holiday promotions and contests asking for personal information or payments to claim a prize. Job listings that require upfront payments for training or supplies. Requests for sensitive personal information (Social Security numbers, banking details) before a formal hiring process. Lack of clear information about the job, the employer, or job location. Unsolicited offers for discounted travel or luxury accommodations. Requests for full payment upfront or via untraceable methods, like wire transfers. Unexpected emails or texts claiming delivery issues with a request for payment or sensitive information. Ways to Avoid It Purchase gift cards directly: Buy gift cards from trusted retailers, either online or in-store, and avoid third-party sellers. Never pay a third party with gift cards: No legitimate company will ask for payments using gift cards. If someone does, itâs a scam. Be cautious of unsolicited offers: Ignore unsolicited emails or social media messages offering free or discounted gift cards. Check the gift card before purchase: Ensure the card hasnât been tampered with before purchasing, especially the area where the code is located. Always book through reputable travel agencies or directly with airlines and hotels. Confirm bookings before making payments. Track deliveries directly through the retailer or shipping service and use secure delivery options if possible (e.g., package lockers or requiring a signature). Ways to Report It Fraudsters exploit the holiday shopping season by using fake promotions or stealing gift card balances. Report the fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Online: Visit ReportFraud.ftc.gov to report the fraud. Provide as many details as possible about the interaction. Phone: Call the FTC at 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) if you prefer to file your complaint over the phone. Report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Online: Submit a complaint to the IC3, a division of the FBI. This is especially useful for internet-related crimes. Contact the gift card issuer Customer service: Contact the customer service department of the gift card issuer to report the fraud. Provide all relevant details including the card number, purchase information, and any correspondence with the scammer. Some companies may be able to freeze the remaining balance on the card if reported quickly. Notify your financial institutions Bank/credit card: Inform your bank or credit card issuer about the fraudulent transaction. Dispute any unauthorized charges and consider requesting your account be closed and a new account opened with new cards. Report to your local law enforcement Local law enforcement: Visit or contact your local law enforcement agency to report the scam. Provide all collected documentation and evidence. Alert the retailer or online marketplace If the scam occurred through an online retailer or marketplace, report it through their customer support or fraud reporting system.

Fraudsters use this trust to deceive victims into sending money or sharing personal information. Common Methods of Imposter Scams Business/bank imposters: Scammers pose as representatives from your bank, credit card company, or a well-known business, asking for your account information or money. Charity scams: Scammers pretend to represent charities, especially after natural disasters or during the holiday season, asking for donations that go directly into their pockets. Family/grandparent scams: Scammers pretend to be a family member, often a grandchild, in distress and needing money urgently.

Fake websites often have poor design, low-quality images, or outdated logos. Be cautious if the site looks unprofessional or has obvious spelling and grammar mistakes. Ways to Avoid It Verify the source: If contacted by someone claiming to be a government official, independently verify their identity by contacting the agency directly through official channels. Do not share personal information: Be wary of unsolicited calls or messages asking for Social Security numbers, bank details, or passwords. Never send money or provide personal details based on an unsolicited call, email, or message. Donât fall for pressure tactics: Legitimate agencies or companies wonât demand immediate payments or personal information under the threat of consequences. Hang up on robocalls: If you receive an automated call from someone you donât know, you can just hang up. Do not respond to unsolicited emails or texts: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments provided in these communications. Never share your personal information or banking information, such as one-time passcodes or passwords. Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Set up account alerts for all transactions and review your statements frequently for unauthorized charges or unusual and suspicious activity.

Mortgage fraud involves deceit or misrepresentation in the origination or funding of a mortgage loan. How It Works Mortgage fraud target individuals looking for home loans or financial assistance. Fraudsters may offer misleading or deceptive loan terms, demand upfront fees, or promise help with a foreclosure in exchange for payment, but they never deliver on these promises to help. Common Methods of Mortgage Fraud Foreclosure rescue scams: Scammers charge upfront fees with false promises to save the home from foreclosure. Loan modification scams: False promises to modify loans or reduce mortgage payments. Predatory lending: Lenders offer loans with high fees, abusive terms, or hidden charges.

Unsolicited offers to help you avoid foreclosure or to secure a new mortgage loan at rates that seem too good to be true. Pressure to sign documents immediately without giving you time to read or review them. Requests for personal or financial information, like bank account details or Social Security numbers, in the context of obtaining a mortgage loan, without any legitimate reason. Incorrect details on mortgage loan applications, artificially high property appraisals, identity theft during mortgage transactions, or scams that aim to steal equity from your home. Ways to Avoid It Work with trusted lenders: Only work with lenders that are accredited and registered with the government. Never pay upfront fees for loan modification help: Legitimate loan modification programs donât require you to pay in advance. Get everything in writing: Donât sign anything until you fully understand the terms and have had time to review the documents. Seek U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved counseling for information about your mortgage loan payment options: If youâre facing foreclosure, contact a HUD-approved housing counseling agency for assistance.

These emails usually include spelling and grammar errors and use generic greetings rather than your name. Fake websites: Websites that mimic legitimate sites to capture your personal or financial data. These sites usually include slight misspellings in the domain name and have outdated logos. Online shopping scams: Non-existent goods/services after payment. Investment/loan scams: Promises of high returns or favorable loans that are fraudulent.

Requests for remote access to your computer, often under the guise of fixing a problem. False receipts received via email showing your purchase of software, such as anti-virus software, in the hopes you will contact them. Ransomware/malware: Malicious software that cuts off access to your own data or device and demands a ransom to regain access to your data or device. Ways to Avoid It Avoid clicking on suspicious links: Do not click on links or download attachments from unknown sources, especially in unsolicited emails or texts. Use strong security software: Ensure your devices are protected by up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software. Verify before providing personal information: Always verify the legitimacy of websites and emails before entering sensitive information.

The amendments align with changes that are being concurrently proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a result of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act). The agencies and FinCEN are also issuing a joint statement that describes their proposed rules and the additional steps necessary to implement the AML Act. Note for Community Bank The proposed amendments would apply to all national banks and all federal savings associations, including community banks. Highlights The notice of proposed rulemaking would propose the following changes, among others: Incorporating a risk assessment process in AML/CFT program rules that would require, among other things, consideration of national AML/CFT priorities published by FinCEN. Including customer due diligence requirements to reflect prior amendments to FinCENâs requirements. Including amendments to codify longstanding supervisory expectations and conform to changes made by the AML Act. Encouraging, but not requiring, banks to consider, evaluate, and as appropriate, implement innovative approaches to meet compliance obligations pursuant to the BSA. Background Pursuant to the AML Act, FinCEN is amending its BSA compliance program rules to incorporate national AML/CFT priorities and other changes. The agencies have independent authority to prescribe regulations requiring banks to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor their compliance with the requirements of the BSA. The agencies are proposing to amend their rules concurrently with FinCEN. In 2016, FinCEN amended its AML compliance program rules to incorporate customer due diligence (CDD) requirements, adding beneficial ownership information collection requirements into FinCENâs AML compliance program rule for certain financial institutions, including banks. The proposed rule would add CDD as a required component of the agenciesâ AML/CFT program rules, which would mirror FinCENâs existing rule.

BSA/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Examinations The OCC conducts regular examinations of national banks, federal savings associations, federal branches, and agencies of foreign banks in the U.S. to determine compliance with the BSA. BSA & Related Regulations The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 USC 5311 et seq establishes program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for national banks, federal savings associations, federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. The OCC's implementing regulations are found at 12 CFR 21.11 and 12 CFR 21.21. The BSA was amended to incorporate the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act which requires every bank to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program. BSA Law Enforcement Tools and Resources In addition to utilizing information filed by banks in money laundering and terrorist financing investigations, U.S. law enforcement also provides banks with access to resources and tools such as those listed here that can be used to strengthen your BSA/AML risk management programs. BSA/AML Bulletins, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Advisories, & Related BASEL Information The OCC and the U.S. Department of Treasury periodically issue alerts, advisories and rulemakings concerning institutions or individuals who may be engaged in fraudulent activities or be deemed to be of high-risk for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. BSA/AML Innovative Industry Approaches & Other Related Links The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the National Credit Union Administration issued a statement encouraging banks to take innovative approaches to meet their Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) compliance obligations and further strengthen the financial system against illicit financial activity. Counter-Terrorist Financing U.S. banks play a key role in combating the financing of terrorism by identifying and reporting potentially suspicious activity as required under the BSA. A number of resources are available to assist you in this effort. Money Laundering Criminals have long used money-laundering schemes to conceal or ""clean"" the source of fraudulently obtained or stolen funds. Money laundering poses significant risks to the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial industry. With the advent of terrorists who employ money-laundering techniques to fund their operations, the risk expands to encompass the safety and security of the nation. Through sound operations, banks play an important role in helping investigative and regulatory agencies identify money-laundering entities and take appropriate action. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and related anti-money laundering laws, banks must Establish effective BSA compliance programs Establish effective customer due diligence systems and monitoring programs Screen against Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and other government lists Establish an effective suspicious activity monitoring and reporting process Develop risk-based anti-money laundering programs Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) As of April 1, 2013, financial institutions must use the Bank Secrecy Act BSA E-Filing System in order to submit Suspicious Activity Reports. A financial institution is required to file a suspicious activity report no later than 30 calendar days after the date of initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a suspicious activity report. If no suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident requiring the filing, a financial institution may delay filing a suspicious activity report for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), financial institutions are required to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering, such as: Keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, File reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and Report suspicious activity that might signal criminal activity (e.g., money laundering, tax evasion) An amendment to the BSA incorporates provisions of the USA Patriot Act, which requires every bank to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program.

The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. The OCC does not have any enforcement actions against banks to release in September. The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term âinstitution-affiliated party,â or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs: Order of Prohibition against Armando De Leon, former Store Manager at a Hialeah, Florida, branch of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, based on the OCCâs uncontested allegations in the Notice of Charges that, among other things, De Leon submitted fraudulent Payment Protection Program (PPP) loan applications, received over $80,000 in PPP loan proceeds, and used the funds for personal gain. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-35) Order of Prohibition against Carolyn H. Hicks, former Bank Operations Assistant Manager at a Columbus, Georgia, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for misappropriating approximately $25,000 from a bank ATM. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-43) Order of Prohibition against Charron Meadows, former Team Manager at a Mount Laurel, New Jersey, call center of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for misappropriating at least $150,000 from the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-41) Order of Prohibition against Gerald E. Milligan II, former Teller at a Royal Palm, Florida, branch of PNC Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, based on the OCCâs uncontested allegations in the Notice of Charges that, among other things, Milligan knowingly made false attestations and provided false supporting documentation for a PPP loan application, received PPP loan proceeds in the amount of $141,530, and used the funds for personal gain. (Docket No. AA-EC-2024-12) Order of Prohibition against Walther Riano-Vanegas, former Teller at a Linden, New Jersey, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for stealing $15,670 from two ATMs at the branch.

Removal of reputation risk references is identified by a strikethrough. Refer to OCC Bulletin 2025-4. Summary The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is issuing this bulletin to inform national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies (collectively, banks) of sound fraud risk management principles. This bulletin supplements other OCC and interagency issuances on corporate and risk governance, including the references listed in appendix A of this bulletin. Note for Community Banks This guidance applies to all OCC-supervised banks. Highlights The risk management principles addressed in this bulletin include the following: A bank should have sound corporate governance practices that instill a corporate culture of ethical standards and promote employee accountability. A bank's risk management system should include policies, processes, personnel, and control systems to effectively identify, measure, monitor, and control fraud risk consistent with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile. A bank's risk management system and system of internal controls should be designed to prevent and detect fraud. appropriately respond to fraud, suspected fraud, or allegations of fraud. Bank management should assess the likelihood and impact of potential fraud schemes and use the results of this assessment to inform the design of the bank's risk management system. Senior management and the board of directors should measure, monitor, and understand fraud losses across the enterprise and employ tools that appropriately quantify and assess loss experience and exposure. Control reviews and audits should include fraud risk as part of their assessments. Fraud risk management principles can be implemented in a variety of ways and may not always be structured within a formal fraud risk management program. Regardless of the structure, fraud risk management should be commensurate with the bank's risk profile. Banks with significant and far-reaching retail-oriented business activities should have well-documented fraud risk management programs with appropriate monitoring, measurements and reporting, and mitigation. Background Fraud may generally be characterized as an intentional act, misstatement, or omission designed to deceive others, resulting in the victim suffering a loss or the perpetrator achieving a gain.1 Fraud is typically categorized as internal or external. Internal fraud occurs when a director, an employee, a former employee, or a third party engaged by the bank commits fraud, colludes to commit fraud, or otherwise enables or contributes to fraud. External fraud consists of first-party fraud and victim fraud. External fraud is committed by a person or entity that is not a bank employee, a former employee, or a third party engaged by the bank. First-party fraud occurs when an external party, including a bank customer, commits fraud against the bank. Victim fraud occurs when a bank customer or client is the victim of an intentional fraudulent act. Fraud schemes are often ongoing crimes that can go undetected for months or even years and can be time consuming and costly to address. It is often difficult to fully understand and quantify the extent of the fraud and the harm caused. Measuring losses associated with fraud is often an inexact process. Typically, the true cost of fraud is greater than the direct financial loss, given the time and expense to investigate, loss of productivity, potential legal and compliance costs associated with remediation, and impact on a bank's reputation. Fraud risk is a form of operational risk, which is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events.2 Operational risk management weaknesses can result in heightened exposure to fraudulent activities, which can increase a bank's exposure to reputation and strategic risks. Failure to maintain an appropriate risk management system could expose the bank to the risk of significant fraud, defalcation (e.g., misappropriation of funds by an employee), and other operational losses. Governance Strong governance is of paramount importance to controlling the bank's exposure to fraud, and a strong corporate culture against fraud is crucial regardless of a bank's size or complexity. The tone at the top sets the foundation on which the bank operates. The board and senior management have a responsibility to lead by example and demonstrate that the bank is serious about promoting ethical behavior to deter and prevent fraud. The board-adopted code of ethics (or code of conduct) should encourage the timely communication and escalation of suspected fraud through the appropriate oversight channel. The board is ultimately responsible for oversight but may delegate fraud risk management-related duties to specific committees (for example, the audit committee or operational risk management committee). The board also may delegate anti-fraud responsibilities to specific executives and managers, including those in charge of managing risks and controls. Roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined. The board should hold management accountable for effective fraud risk management and alignment of anti-fraud efforts with the bank's strategy, objectives, risk appetite, and operational plans. While not all fraud can be avoided, an active board can foster an environment in which fraud is more likely to be prevented, deterred, and promptly detected. A sound corporate culture should discourage imprudent risk-taking. Incentives or requirements for employees to meet sales goals, financial performance goals, and other business goals, particularly if such goals are aggressive, can result in heightened fraud risk.3 Risk Management Sound fraud risk management principles should be integrated within the bank's risk management system commensurate with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile. Bank management should periodically assess the likelihood and impact of potential fraud schemes and use the documented results of this assessment to inform the design of the bank's risk management system and evaluate fraud control activities. Policies should clearly define, establish, and communicate the board's and senior management's commitment to fraud risk management. Processes should be designed to anticipate fraud and deploy a combination of preventive controls and detective controls. Detective controls are important because even with strong governance and oversight, collusion or circumvention of internal controls can allow fraud to occur. Some practices and controls may be both preventive and detective in nature. Preventive controls are designed to deter fraud or minimize its likelihood. The following are some examples: Policies and processes (e.g., ethics policies, code of conduct, identity theft program,4 and elder abuse policies) Anti-fraud awareness campaigns for board, senior management, staff, and third parties Fraud risk management training for employees and contractors commensurate with roles and responsibilities Customer education on fraud risks and preventive measures customers can take to reduce the risk of becoming victims System controls designed to prevent employees, agents, third parties, and others from conducting fraudulent transactions, performing inappropriate manual overrides, or manipulating financial reporting Controls to prevent fraudulent account opening, closing, or transactions Dual controls (e.g., over monetary instruments, accounting, customer transactions, and reporting) Segregation of duties Background investigations for new employees and periodic checks for existing employees and third parties Training customer-facing employees to identify potential victim fraud Sound information security programs5 Job breaks, such as mandatory consecutive two-week vacations or rotation of duties Customer identification program procedures, customer due diligence processes, and beneficial ownership identification and verification6 Real-time transaction analysis and behavioral analytics Detective controls are designed to identify and respond to fraud after it has occurred. The following are some examples: Models, monitoring systems, or reports designed to detect fraudulent activity across all lines of business and functions (e.g., exception reports, unusual card activity, unauthorized transactions, file maintenance reports, fee waiver analysis, and employee surveillance processes [account monitoring, system access patterns, and overrides]) Data analytics (e.g., loss data analysis, transactions, fee waivers, interest forgiven, charge-offs, errors, and consumer complaint data) Effective complaint resolution processes7 Monitoring and analysis of civil and criminal subpoenas received by the bank or information requests under section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act8 Monitoring and analysis of Bank Secrecy Act report filings by the bank and its affiliates Monitoring of news and other information concerning civil and criminal lawsuits Ethics and whistleblower reporting channels or hotlines Exit interviews for departing employees Software and technology tools, developed internally or purchased from a third party, can assist with anti-fraud efforts. Bank management should consider the cost and value of fraud prevention tools selected, consistent with the bank's overall strategy, complexity, and risk profile. Depending on the specific products and services offered, management might deploy solutions that serve to detect anomalies and prevent potential fraudulent transactions or activities. These solutions can monitor transactions and behaviors, employ layered or multifactor authentication, monitor networks for intrusions or malware, analyze transactions on internal bank platforms, and compare data with consortium or publicly available data. Banks' fraud prevention and detection tools should evolve and adapt to remain effective against emerging fraud types. Fraud Risk Measurement and Monitoring Senior management should understand the bank's exposure to fraud risk and associated losses across all business lines and functions and use this information to effectively monitor and manage fraud risk. The board should receive regular reporting on the bank's fraud risk assessment, resulting exposure to fraud risk, and associated losses to enable directors to understand the bank's fraud risk profile. Reporting should allow management and directors to measure performance. Practices can include benchmarking current fraud losses against loss history or industry data. Examples of metrics and analysis banks can use to measure and monitor fraud risk include the following: Metrics by fraud type (e.g., internal, external, loan, card, account opening, check, or embezzlement) Fraud losses (e.g., per open account, closed account, or litigation) Fraud recoveries Net fraud losses Fraud loss budget variance Automated clearing house return rates Percentage of customers claiming victim fraud Fraud control performance and control testing results Trend analysis of data such as number and dollar of fraud investigations customer complaints Bank Secrecy Act report metrics (e.g., Suspicious Activity Report [SAR] filings) civil and criminal subpoenas information requests under section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act Management should identify fraud losses as internal or external. Larger, more complex banks generally maintain this information in an operational loss database or similar system.9 Fraud Response, Reporting, and Information Sharing A bank's policies, processes, and control systems should prompt appropriate and timely investigations into, responses to, and reporting of suspected and confirmed fraud. Banks should have processes for internal investigations, law enforcement referrals, regulatory notifications,10 and reporting. A bank is required to file a SAR for known or suspected fraud meeting regulatory thresholds.11 Reporting mechanisms should relay relevant, accurate, and timely fraud-related information from all lines of business to appropriate oversight channels. Sound fraud risk management processes can include voluntary sharing of information with other financial institutions under section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act. Pursuant to section 314(b), before exchanging information, the bank must register with the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Current section 314(b) participants may share information with one another regarding individuals, entities, organizations, and countries for purposes of identifying and, when appropriate, reporting activities that may involve possible specified unlawful activities. FinCEN has issued guidance clarifying that, if section 314(b) participants suspect that transactions may involve the proceeds of specified unlawful activities, such as fraud, under the money laundering statutes,12 information related to such transactions can be shared under the protection of the section 314(b) safe harbor.13 Reviews and Audits A bank should design and perform reviews and audits specific to the bank's size, complexity, organizational structure, and risk profile. Reviews and audits should be designed to assess the effectiveness of the bank's internal controls and fraud risk management. Effective internal and external audit programs are a critical defense against fraud and provide vital information to the board of directors about the effectiveness of internal control systems. Reviews and audits typically include the following:14 Quality assurance and quality control reviews Independent risk management reviews Internal and external audits Retrospective reviews after fraud is identified Third-party relationship audits (or audit reports) consistent with contractual provisions When auditing financial statements and asserting effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, auditors must consider a material misstatement due to fraud.15 If the auditor identifies that fraud may be present, the auditor must discuss these findings with the board or management in a timely fashion.16 The auditor must also determine whether they have a responsibility to report the suspected fraud to the OCC.17 Findings and results from audits and reviews should be communicated to the relevant parties in a timely manner. Management should take timely and effective corrective action in response to deficiencies identified. Further Information Please contact Tanya A.

This bulletin does not address other risks, such as interest rate risk.2 Recission This bulletin rescinds Banking Bulletin 1993-50, âLoan Refinancing.â Note for Community Banks This bulletin applies to all banks with commercial loans. Highlights This bulletin discusses the effect of refinance risk on credit risk in commercial loan transactions and portfolios. provides guidance on transaction and portfolio-level refinance risk management. Background Refinance risk is the risk that borrowers will not be able to replace existing debt at a future date under reasonable terms and prevailing market conditions. Refinance risk increases in rising interest rate environments and can be amplified by large volumes of loans set to mature in underperforming markets.3 If a borrower cannot refinance under current market conditions, a bank could be burdened with an underperforming or nonperforming loan. Refinance risk primarily affects loans with principal balances remaining at maturity and borrowers who rely on recurring debt to finance their capital structure or business operations. Examples of loan types most affected by refinance risk include interest-only loans, commercial real estate loans,4 leveraged loans, and revolving working capital lines. Fully amortizing loans to sound borrowers generally have lower refinance risk than loans that are not fully amortizing. Refinance risk affects individual loans and portfolios of loans. A concentration in such loans could increase the cost and complexity of problem loan resolutions when borrowers are under stress. In addition, if a significant volume or amount of loans refinance during adverse economic conditions, it could constrain a bankâs capital or liquidity, threaten earnings, or hinder strategic initiatives.5 Refinance risk can be driven by external factors or borrower-specific factors. External factors that affect refinance risk include investor risk appetite and market liquidity; the current interest rate environment; inflation; or supply chain effects on the costs of goods, services, or labor. Refinance risk increases in rising interest rate environments because borrowers may be unable to service their debt at higher interest rates upon refinance. Refinance risk may also increase for some borrowers or portfolios because of declining industry fundamentals or changes in commodity prices. Borrower-specific drivers for heightened refinance risk include high leverage, constrained liquidity, a significant volume of near-term maturities, poor financial performance, or unpopular market sentiment. Guidance Banks should have processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control refinance risk at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The tools to monitor refinance risk should be tailored to the bankâs size, complexity, risk profile, and types of lending. Sound transaction-level credit risk management practices include assessing refinance risk at underwriting, during ongoing monitoring, and near maturity. At the portfolio level, banks should have systems and processes to monitor the volume and cadence of upcoming loan maturities. Independent credit risk review should consider the level of refinance risk when determining an appropriate review scope and assessing credit quality.6 One common method to assess refinance risk at the transaction and portfolio level is multivariable stress testing. Transaction-level stress testing can provide insight into the borrowerâs ability to meet refinancing requirements if the borrowerâs financial condition declines or market conditions deteriorate (e.g., interest rates increase, market terms tighten, expenses increase, or collateral values fall). Portfolio-level stress testing can identify and measure the potential effect of changing market conditions on portfolio segments with higher refinance risk.7 Transaction-Level Risk Management and Risk-Rating Considerations Banks should evaluate refinance risk when approving and structuring loans, during ongoing monitoring (e.g., annual reviews), near loan maturity, and when considering granting extensions or renewals. Refinance risk can also be a factor when risk-rating a loan. A prudent assessment of refinance risk includes a borrowerâs refinancing needs, the performance of the underlying project or asset, the timing of a refinancing transaction (e.g., maturity), the amount and maturity dates of other debt, current market liquidity, and the cost of refinancing. At origination, banks can structure a loan to mitigate refinance risk. For example, underwriting standards may include debt service coverage or loan-to-value requirements that provide a cushion if a borrowerâs financial condition declines or market conditions deteriorate. Banks may also require covenants that preserve the borrowerâs ability to refinance (e.g., leverage covenants or limits on incremental debt) or trigger action before maturity to protect the bank (e.g., debt service coverage ratios or liquidity ratios). During ongoing monitoring and near maturity, management should conduct analysis to determine the borrowerâs refinance requirements and ability to reasonably qualify for another market rate loan to cover the projected outstanding principal. The analysis can also provide insight into the likelihood that a borrower might seek refinancing prior to maturity (e.g., to support significant business expansion, because of a leveraged buyout, or to pay out a retiring partner). Effective analysis of refinance risk includes a loanâs performance compared with expectations at underwriting, the time horizon for a refinance event, borrower-specific factors, and external factors. Analysis should include determining whether a borrower can meet current underwriting standards, including prevailing interest rates, for similar loans. Banks should have refinance plans in place for borrowers with near-term refinancing needs. While market demand could affect a borrowerâs ability to refinance, generally the stronger a borrowerâs underlying financial performance, the more refinance options are available. For loans maturing with an outstanding principal balance or otherwise likely to require near-term refinancing, credit risk ratings should take into account the likelihood that the borrower will be able to obtain refinancing without relying on distressed terms. Refinance risk is just one consideration in determining an appropriate risk rating and should be evaluated in the context of the borrowerâs overall financial condition and debt service ability. While increased refinance risk does not automatically warrant a change in a loanâs risk rating, classification is appropriate when there are well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize repayment. Loans that are adequately protected by the current sound worth and debt service ability of the borrower, guarantor, or the underlying collateral8 generally are not adversely classified.9 Similarly, loans to sound borrowers that are modified in accordance with prudent underwriting standards are generally not adversely classified unless well-defined weaknesses exist that jeopardize repayment. Such loans, however, could be flagged for managementâs attention or for inclusion in designated âwatch lists.â Portfolio-Level Analysis and Risk Management Banks should have processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control refinance risk at the portfolio level. Assessing refinance risk at the portfolio level allows a bank to identify borrowers experiencing similar stresses, whether macroeconomic or specific to an industry or region. Effective processes generally include the ability to identify and monitor the volume and amount of loans maturing with outstanding principal balances and portfolio segments affected by external risk factors. stress-testing to identify portfolios with heightened refinance risk. limits that reflect the bankâs risk appetite. reporting that monitors the level of refinance risk and performance relative to established limits. A bank can mitigate refinance risk by establishing criteria that define when it is appropriate to underwrite loans that will not fully amortize by maturity (e.g., interest-only loans, loans with balloon payments, or revolving loans) and prudent terms for such loans (e.g., re-margining requirements, covenants, or cleanup requirements). Underwriting criteria can also detail the prudent use of interest rate swaps and caps. Banks can further mitigate refinance risk by setting appropriate underwriting exception limits, controls, and reporting (e.g., limiting loans underwritten with covenant-lite structures or with marginal debt service coverage or loan-to-value ratios). Setting and adhering to concentration limits can protect the balance sheet from potential refinancing shocks and bank capital from outsized losses when refinance options are limited. Refinance risk can occur across different lending products, and it is prudent for management to consider whether refinance risk creates correlated exposures not otherwise identified, especially during a deteriorating economic environment.10 Loans Restructured Under a Prudent Loan Workout Plan The OCC encourages banks to work proactively and prudently with borrowers who are, or may be, unable to meet their contractual payment obligations during periods of financial stress. An effective loan workout arrangement should improve the bankâs prospects for repayment of principal and interest, be consistent with sound banking and accounting practices, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.11 Management should consider refinance risk when developing an effective workout strategy. In some cases, as part of a prudent workout plan, a loan originally underwritten with fully amortizing terms is restructured with an outstanding principal payment at maturity. Management should appropriately risk-rate and manage such loans. Management should also measure and monitor the volume of modified and restructured loans. When assessing refinance risk at the portfolio level, management should consider the volume of modified or restructured loans that will no longer fully amortize by maturity. If management determines that a loan refinance represents a modification or accommodation to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty,12 management should perform further analysis to determine whether the loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans and should be reviewed individually when determining an appropriate allowance for credit loss. Management should also determine whether the loan is collateral-dependent.13 Further Information Please contact Barry Mills, Director for Commercial Credit Risk Policy, at (202) 649-6220. Grovetta N.

For more information specific to commercial real estate lending, refer to the âCommercial Real Estate Lendingâ booklet of the Comptrollerâs Handbook. 5 Refinance risk can affect a bankâs interest rate risk when a material amount of loans on the balance sheet with higher levels of refinance risk mature at the same time or within a tight time frame. Loans that are unable to refinance at market terms could result in an unplanned asset/liability price mismatch on a bankâs balance sheet. 6 For more information about credit risk review, refer to OCC Bulletin 2020-50, âCredit Risk: Interagency Guidance on Credit Risk Review Systems.â 7 For more information on stress testing, refer to OCC Bulletin 2012-33, âCommunity Bank Stress Testing: Supervisory Guidance,â and OCC Bulletin 2012-14, âStress Testing: Interagency Stress Testing Guidance.â 8 Collateral value alone is not sufficient to preclude adverse classification when well-defined weaknesses are present.
