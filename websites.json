    "cleaned_text":"['Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu\\nRemarks at the Women in Housing and Finance Public Policy Luncheon\\n\u201cThe Fraud Challenge\u201d\\nDecember 11, 2024\\nThe increasing prevalence of financial fraud presents a special challenge for us as a\\nsociety. While fraud does not have the profile of Basel 3 or cyber risk, its everyday impact in\\npeople\u2019s daily lives warrants attention. Fraud not only harms consumers, but also leads to distrust\\nin others, in institutions, and in the financial system. Effectively addressing this challenge is\\ngoing to require all stakeholders\u2014from banks to social media platforms\u2014to each pull their\\nweight and to act above and beyond what is currently legally required.\\nThe situation reminds me of trash left on the street. I live in the city. Technically, litter\\nthat is not on my property is not my concern. I have no obligation to pick it up. Neither do my\\nneighbors. And yet if no one picks up the errant bits of litter when they walk by, then more litter\\ntends to appear. Passersby feel it is OK to drop their wrapper on the ground or leave their empty\\ncup on the sidewalk when others have done so. Each act of littering and walking by litter is\\nrelatively small. But the cumulative effect is palpable. The neighborhood becomes less nice, less\\ninviting, less orderly, less valued, and can even feel less safe. Over time, if left unaddressed, the\\nsituation becomes accepted as normal.\\nThe steady rise and pervasiveness of fraud today presents each stakeholder, including\\nregulators, with a choice. If everyone does only the minimum of what is legally required of them,', 'consumers will continue to be harmed, people\u2019s distrust in each other and in institutions will\\ncontinue to rise, and elevated levels of fraud will become normalized.\\nThe most efficient and effective way to avoid this outcome would be for each and every\\nstakeholder to step up and do their part to combat fraud. This would mean getting in the habit of\\nleaning down and picking up the proverbial trash instead of just walking by it, even if doing so\\nisn\u2019t legally required.\\nFortunately, the banks I\u2019ve spoken to about addressing fraud are open to this; many have\\nalready begun to act.\\nFirst, I should note the importance of complying with existing laws and regulations to\\npromptly identify, investigate, and resolve fraud concerns, such as under the Expedited Funds\\nAvailability Act (Regulation CC), and to address potentially unfair practices prohibited under\\nSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 1031 of the Dodd\u2013Frank Act. When\\nconsumers fall victim to fraud or scams, they should have confidence that their bank will comply\\nwith applicable laws when researching potentially fraudulent check, debit, and credit card\\ntransactions, including the provisional credit requirements of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act\\n(Regulation E) and the billing error requirements of the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z).\\nSecond, we\u2019ve seen many banks increase their individual efforts to address fraud. These\\nefforts include providing bank customers with relevant information about trending scams and\\nhow to avoid them and improving or tightening fraud detection and monitoring systems to\\nidentify potential frauds in a timely manner. I have heard countless stories of bank branch\\nemployees going the extra mile to educate customers about the risks of wiring all their funds to a\\nsuspicious account.\\n2', 'Third, several bank trade groups have formed fraud task forces to collaborate and share\\ninformation. For example, the American Bankers Association (ABA) has created a check fraud\\nclaim directory,1 which is intended to help banks needing to file a check warranty breach claim\\nwith another financial institution. The Independent Community Bankers of America formed a\\ncheck fraud task force of banks and state bankers\u2019 associations and leads a financial sector fraud\\nworking group.2 And Early Warning System (EWS), which operates the bank-owned Zelle\\nnetwork and was recently cited by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for\\nvarious weaknesses,3 has taken steps to further strengthen its fraud detection program.\\nWhile these and other initiatives are promising and more needs to be done, banks and\\nindustry trade groups cannot effectively address fraud all by themselves. Take, for instance,\\ncheck fraud. The recent rise in check fraud can be traced in large part to bad actors intercepting\\nchecks sent through the U.S. Post Office. To combat this, the ABA and the U.S. Postal\\nInspection Service announced a joint effort to combat check fraud in March 2024.4 The joint\\ninitiative focuses on educating U.S. Postal Service and bank customers, addressing money mules\\nand collusive accountholders, collaborating with law enforcement, and training bank employees\\nand postal workers on red flags and prevention.\\n1 American Bankers Association, \u201cABA Fraud Contact Directory.\u201d\\n2 Independent Community Bankers of America, \u201cCommunity Banks Are Fighting Check Fraud on the Front Lines,\u201d\\nMarch 20, 2024.\\n3 See U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Majority Staff Report, A Fast and Easy Way to Lose\\nMoney: Insufficient Consumer Protection on the Zelle Network, July 23, 2024; U.S. Senate, Committee on\\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \u201cAn Oversight Hearing to Examine How Zelle and the Big Banks\\nFail to Protect Consumers From Fraud,\u201d July 23, 2024.\\n4 American Bankers Association, \u201cABA and U.S. Postal Inspection Service Announce Partnership to Combat Check\\nFraud,\u201d March 19, 2024.\\n3', 'Similarly, a significant amount of fraud on peer-to-peer payment platforms originates\\nfrom users responding to unsolicited text messages, emails, and social media posts.5 In the\\nUnited Kingdom, where liability for such fraud has been assigned to banks, several banking\\norganizations have established a partnership with Meta, the owner of Facebook, to share\\ninformation via a Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange. While relatively new, reports indicate\\nthat in an early pilot, Meta removed 20,000 scam accounts based on the collaboration.6\\nIn a sign that fraud may be becoming normalized, so-called first party fraud is also on the\\nrise. Take, for instance, the recent check-kiting social media posts regarding JPMorgan ATMs\\nthat went viral on TikTok. A temporary technical glitch let customers deposit large checks in\\nATMs and withdraw funds immediately before the checks could clear. Recent media reports\\nnoted that the bank is investigating thousands of possible check fraud incidents related to this\\nATM glitch.7\\nA laissez-faire view of this might conclude that as long as no laws or regulations are\\nbeing violated, elevated levels of fraud may simply be the new normal, the cost of innovation\\n5 Federal Trade Commission, \u201cWho Experiences Scams? A Story for All Ages,\u201d December 8, 2022. For instance,\\naccording to data from the Federal Trade Commission, in 2021 social media was the single biggest starting point for\\nscams against Americans ages 18\u201359; 31 percent of people in that age range who reported losing money to a scam\\nsaid that the scheme started on social media. For those ages 18\u201329, nearly 40 percent of those who reported losing\\nmoney to a scam said the scam originated on social media. Among adults 60 years or older, that percentage was 15\\npercent. See also Payment Systems Regulator Ltd., Authorised Push Payment (APP) Scams Performance Report,\\nJuly 2024.\\n6 PYMNTS, \u201cMeta Teams With UK Banks to Fight Scammers,\u201d October 2, 2024.\\n7 For example, Payments Dive, \u201cViral JPMorgan Chase Glitch Is \u2018Fraud, Plain and Simple,\u2019 Bank Says,\u201d September\\n4, 2024; Reuters, \u201cJPMorgan Sues Customers Over Check Fraud Linked to Glitch That Went Viral,\u201d October 28,\\n2024.\\n4', 'and technological advancement. I believe this underestimates the cumulative sense of disorder\\nand distrust that can emanate from seemingly small but repeated acts of fraud.8\\nAs with many collective action problems, public-private partnerships can be effective.\\nFor instance, coordination and information-sharing efforts focused on cyber risks provide a\\nuseful model for consideration. At the OCC, we are focused on supporting and encouraging these\\nand other collaborative fraud education and fraud prevention efforts. In addition, we are\\nregularly engaging with our partners in interagency and international efforts to strengthen\\nregulatory and supervisory responses to financial fraud. This includes participating in various\\nworking groups with representatives from industry, financial regulators, and law enforcement.\\nBanks and bank regulators can and will need to do more to address fraud. But they cannot\\nsolve the problem on their own. Social media platforms, telecommunication companies, email\\nhosts, the U.S. Postal Service, and law enforcement need to step up and do their part as well to\\nkeep the proverbial streets clean, safe, and trusted. The OCC looks forward to continued and\\nenhanced collaboration with all stakeholders to address this important issue.\\n8 See The Ezra Klein Show, \u201cThe Hidden Politics of Disorder,\u201d, Apple Podcasts, October 18, 2024.\\n5']"

For purposes of the request for information, payments fraud generally refers to the use of illegal means to make or receive payments for personal gain, including scams. Because payments fraud may involve multiple institutions and payment methods, no single agency or private-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. Therefore, the agencies are seeking public comment on discrete actions, collectively or independently, to mitigate payments fraud, including check fraud, within their respective bank regulation and payments authorities. Input is requested on five potential areas for improvement and collaboration: External collaboration among the agencies, Federal Reserve Banks, and industry stakeholders; Consumer, business, and industry education by the agencies and Federal Reserve Banks to educate about payments fraud; Regulation and supervision to mitigate payments fraud, including opportunities the Board may have related to check fraud; Payments fraud data collection and information sharing; and Federal Reserve Banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 operator tools and services to reduce payments fraud. In addition to seeking public input, the agencies will also continue looking for additional opportunities to effectively collaborate across other state and federal agencies given the importance of interagency coordination to help mitigate payments fraud. Comments must be received within 90 days after date of publication in the Federal Register.

Introduction\\nPayments fraud inflicts significant harm on consumers, businesses, and financial\\ninstitutions. Payments fraud also has the potential to erode public trust in\u2014and\\nundermine the safety, accessibility, and efficiency of\u2014the nation\u2019s payments system,\\nupon which the U.S. financial system depends. As part of their objectives to promote the\\nsafety of the U.S. financial system, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC have overlapping but also\\ndiscrete roles and authorities related to the issue of payments fraud. For example, the\\nBoard, FDIC, and OCC all engage in supervision of financial institutions. In addition to\\nsupervising financial institutions, the FDIC has the distinct mission to maintain stability\\nand public confidence in the nation\u2019s financial system as the insurer of bank deposits.\\nThe FRS, which includes the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks), also\\nfocuses on payment system safety as a payment system operator and catalyst for payment\\nsystem improvements. Therefore, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC are each interested in\\nexploring ways to help mitigate risk of payments fraud.

How It Works Check fraud occurs when an unauthorized person uses someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s checks, or images of a check, to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals. Common Methods of Check Fraud Check fraud: Scammers steal, or forge checks to make unauthorized transactions. Check washing: Fraudsters alter or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwash\u00e2\u0080\u009d legitimate checks with chemicals to erase the ink from a check to rewrite amounts and payees. Mail fraud: Defrauding others by sending or receiving fraudulent checks through the mail. Warning Signs Unfamiliar checking account transactions appear on your bank statements. Your bank notifies you of unauthorized account activity. You receive calls from your bank about checks you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write or transactions you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make. Someone unsolicited contacts you with a request to deposit a check for any reason, especially to make money on a limited time offer of any kind. You receive a check in the mail related to employment as a mystery shopper, personal assistant, or for being the winner of a prize. Ways to Avoid It Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Set up account alerts for all transactions and review your statements frequently for unauthorized charges or unusual and suspicious activity. Use black gel ink on checks: Black gel ink is highly resistant to check washing, a common scheme where chemicals are used to erase ink from a check to rewrite amounts and payees. Get mail promptly after delivery and avoid leaving mail in your mailbox overnight. When sending checks, consider using the letter slots in your post office to send mail. Be wary of sending money or any medium of payment to someone after taking a check from them for any reason. Scammers often claim overpayment or demand you send or wire money after they give you a bad check. Ways to Report It Taking prompt and comprehensive action when faced with check fraud can help mitigate any potential damage and ensure that the fraudulent charges are resolved effectively. Notify your financial institution Bank: Inform your bank about the fraudulent transaction. Dispute any unauthorized charges and consider requesting your account be closed and a new account opened.

How It Works Credit card and debit card fraud occurs when a person uses someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s card or card information to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals. This can happen through physical theft of the card or by stealing card information online or through card skimming devices. Common Methods of Credit Card and Debit Card Fraud Account takeover: A fraudster takes control of a credit or debit card account to make unauthorized transactions. Card-not-present fraud: An unauthorized person uses stolen card details to make online purchases. Card skimming: Devices capture card information at ATMs or point-of-sale terminals, such as at gas pumps. Mail fraud: A scheme by a fraudster to intercept a credit or debit card from the mail before the intended account holder receives it. Phone thefts and fraud: Fraudsters target smartphones to access sensitive financial information, digital cards, banking apps, and wallets stored on the device.

Be cautious with ATMs and other point-of-sale terminals: Use ATMs located at secure, well-lit locations, and cover the keypad when entering your PIN to prevent skimming devices from capturing your information. Check if any parts of a point-of-sale terminal are loose or wiggle. Keep your cards secure: Never share your card details with anyone, and report lost or stolen cards immediately. Use strong passwords: Ensure all your online accounts have long, complex passwords and enable two-factor authentication where possible. Be sure all your online accounts have different passwords. Ways to Report It Taking prompt and comprehensive action when faced with credit card or debit card fraud can help mitigate any potential damage and ensure that the fraudulent charges are resolved effectively. Contact your card issuer immediately Phone: Call the customer service number found on the back of your credit or debit card or on the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website.

Fraudsters exploit the popularity of gift cards as convenient presents by tricking individuals into purchasing gift cards for fictitious reasons or stealing funds from purchased cards. These scams are particularly effective during the holiday rush, as people may be less vigilant and more likely to fall for high-pressure tactics or deals that appear time-sensitive. How It Works Scammers exploit the increased financial activity that occurs during the holiday season when consumers can be distracted to carry out a range of fraudulent schemes. Common Methods of Holiday and Gift Card Scams Delivery scams: Scammers may take advantage of increased package deliveries by sending fake notifications about undelivered packages to trick recipients into providing personal information or payment details. Gift card fraud: Scammers trick victims into paying for services or fines using gift cards, or they steal the balance from legitimate gift cards. Holiday shopping scams: Fake holiday sales or promotions lure consumers into making purchases from fraudulent websites, but the customer never receives their items. Phony charities: Fraudsters create fake charities during the holiday season to exploit people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goodwill and collect donations that are never used for the stated cause. Seasonal employment scams: During the holiday season, many people seek temporary jobs in retail, delivery services, and other industries. Scammers exploit this demand by posting fake job listings. Victims are sometimes asked to provide personal information, pay upfront fees, or work without compensation. Travel scams: As people book holiday travel, scammers may offer fake travel deals, cheap flights, or holiday vacation packages. Victims may pay upfront, only to find the tickets or bookings do not exist. Warning Signs Requests for payment via gift cards for services or fines. No legitimate business or government agency will ask for payment in this form. Gift cards that appear to have been tampered with, such as torn packaging or scratched-off security codes. Unsolicited messages offering discounted or free gift cards. Holiday promotions and contests asking for personal information or payments to claim a prize. Job listings that require upfront payments for training or supplies. Requests for sensitive personal information (Social Security numbers, banking details) before a formal hiring process. Lack of clear information about the job, the employer, or job location. Unsolicited offers for discounted travel or luxury accommodations. Requests for full payment upfront or via untraceable methods, like wire transfers. Unexpected emails or texts claiming delivery issues with a request for payment or sensitive information. Ways to Avoid It Purchase gift cards directly: Buy gift cards from trusted retailers, either online or in-store, and avoid third-party sellers. Never pay a third party with gift cards: No legitimate company will ask for payments using gift cards. If someone does, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scam. Be cautious of unsolicited offers: Ignore unsolicited emails or social media messages offering free or discounted gift cards. Check the gift card before purchase: Ensure the card hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been tampered with before purchasing, especially the area where the code is located. Always book through reputable travel agencies or directly with airlines and hotels. Confirm bookings before making payments. Track deliveries directly through the retailer or shipping service and use secure delivery options if possible (e.g., package lockers or requiring a signature). Ways to Report It Fraudsters exploit the holiday shopping season by using fake promotions or stealing gift card balances. Report the fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Online: Visit ReportFraud.ftc.gov to report the fraud. Provide as many details as possible about the interaction. Phone: Call the FTC at 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) if you prefer to file your complaint over the phone. Report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) Online: Submit a complaint to the IC3, a division of the FBI. This is especially useful for internet-related crimes. Contact the gift card issuer Customer service: Contact the customer service department of the gift card issuer to report the fraud. Provide all relevant details including the card number, purchase information, and any correspondence with the scammer. Some companies may be able to freeze the remaining balance on the card if reported quickly. Notify your financial institutions Bank\/credit card: Inform your bank or credit card issuer about the fraudulent transaction. Dispute any unauthorized charges and consider requesting your account be closed and a new account opened with new cards. Report to your local law enforcement Local law enforcement: Visit or contact your local law enforcement agency to report the scam. Provide all collected documentation and evidence. Alert the retailer or online marketplace If the scam occurred through an online retailer or marketplace, report it through their customer support or fraud reporting system.

False receipts received via email showing your purchase of software, such as anti-virus software, in the hopes you will contact them. Ransomware\/malware: Malicious software that cuts off access to your own data or device and demands a ransom to regain access to your data or device.

The amendments align with changes that are being concurrently proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a result of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act). The agencies and FinCEN are also issuing a joint statement that describes their proposed rules and the additional steps necessary to implement the AML Act. Note for Community Bank The proposed amendments would apply to all national banks and all federal savings associations, including community banks. Highlights The notice of proposed rulemaking would propose the following changes, among others: Incorporating a risk assessment process in AML\/CFT program rules that would require, among other things, consideration of national AML\/CFT priorities published by FinCEN. Including customer due diligence requirements to reflect prior amendments to FinCEN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirements. Including amendments to codify longstanding supervisory expectations and conform to changes made by the AML Act. Encouraging, but not requiring, banks to consider, evaluate, and as appropriate, implement innovative approaches to meet compliance obligations pursuant to the BSA. Background Pursuant to the AML Act, FinCEN is amending its BSA compliance program rules to incorporate national AML\/CFT priorities and other changes. The agencies have independent authority to prescribe regulations requiring banks to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor their compliance with the requirements of the BSA. The agencies are proposing to amend their rules concurrently with FinCEN. In 2016, FinCEN amended its AML compliance program rules to incorporate customer due diligence (CDD) requirements, adding beneficial ownership information collection requirements into FinCEN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AML compliance program rule for certain financial institutions, including banks. The proposed rule would add CDD as a required component of the agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 AML\/CFT program rules, which would mirror FinCEN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing rule. Further Information Please contact Jina Cheon, Special Counsel; Melissa Lisenbee, Counsel; Priscilla Benner, Counsel; Scott Burnett, Counsel; or Henry Barkhausen, Counsel; Chief Counsel's Office, at (202) 649-5490.

BSA\/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Examinations The OCC conducts regular examinations of national banks, federal savings associations, federal branches, and agencies of foreign banks in the U.S. to determine compliance with the BSA. BSA & Related Regulations The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 USC 5311 et seq establishes program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for national banks, federal savings associations, federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. The OCC's implementing regulations are found at 12 CFR 21.11 and 12 CFR 21.21. The BSA was amended to incorporate the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act which requires every bank to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program. BSA Law Enforcement Tools and Resources In addition to utilizing information filed by banks in money laundering and terrorist financing investigations, U.S. law enforcement also provides banks with access to resources and tools such as those listed here that can be used to strengthen your BSA\/AML risk management programs. BSA\/AML Bulletins, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Advisories, & Related BASEL Information The OCC and the U.S. Department of Treasury periodically issue alerts, advisories and rulemakings concerning institutions or individuals who may be engaged in fraudulent activities or be deemed to be of high-risk for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. BSA\/AML Innovative Industry Approaches & Other Related Links The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the National Credit Union Administration issued a statement encouraging banks to take innovative approaches to meet their Bank Secrecy Act\/anti-money laundering (BSA\/AML) compliance obligations and further strengthen the financial system against illicit financial activity. Counter-Terrorist Financing U.S. banks play a key role in combating the financing of terrorism by identifying and reporting potentially suspicious activity as required under the BSA. A number of resources are available to assist you in this effort. Money Laundering Criminals have long used money-laundering schemes to conceal or \"clean\" the source of fraudulently obtained or stolen funds. Money laundering poses significant risks to the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial industry. With the advent of terrorists who employ money-laundering techniques to fund their operations, the risk expands to encompass the safety and security of the nation. Through sound operations, banks play an important role in helping investigative and regulatory agencies identify money-laundering entities and take appropriate action. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and related anti-money laundering laws, banks must Establish effective BSA compliance programs Establish effective customer due diligence systems and monitoring programs Screen against Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and other government lists Establish an effective suspicious activity monitoring and reporting process Develop risk-based anti-money laundering programs Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) As of April 1, 2013, financial institutions must use the Bank Secrecy Act BSA E-Filing System in order to submit Suspicious Activity Reports. A financial institution is required to file a suspicious activity report no later than 30 calendar days after the date of initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a suspicious activity report. If no suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident requiring the filing, a financial institution may delay filing a suspicious activity report for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), financial institutions are required to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering, such as: Keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, File reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and Report suspicious activity that might signal criminal activity (e.g., money laundering, tax evasion) An amendment to the BSA incorporates provisions of the USA Patriot Act, which requires every bank to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program.

The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. The OCC does not have any enforcement actions against banks to release in September. The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution-affiliated party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs: Order of Prohibition against Armando De Leon, former Store Manager at a Hialeah, Florida, branch of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, based on the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncontested allegations in the Notice of Charges that, among other things, De Leon submitted fraudulent Payment Protection Program (PPP) loan applications, received over $80,000 in PPP loan proceeds, and used the funds for personal gain. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-35) Order of Prohibition against Carolyn H. Hicks, former Bank Operations Assistant Manager at a Columbus, Georgia, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for misappropriating approximately $25,000 from a bank ATM. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-43) Order of Prohibition against Charron Meadows, former Team Manager at a Mount Laurel, New Jersey, call center of TD Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for misappropriating at least $150,000 from the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-41) Order of Prohibition against Gerald E. Milligan II, former Teller at a Royal Palm, Florida, branch of PNC Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, based on the OCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncontested allegations in the Notice of Charges that, among other things, Milligan knowingly made false attestations and provided false supporting documentation for a PPP loan application, received PPP loan proceeds in the amount of $141,530, and used the funds for personal gain. (Docket No. AA-EC-2024-12) Order of Prohibition against Walther Riano-Vanegas, former Teller at a Linden, New Jersey, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for stealing $15,670 from two ATMs at the branch. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-40) The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in compliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d into a new action. Termination actions include: Order Terminating the Cease and Desist Order against Gateway Bank, F.S.B., Oakland, California, dated November 12, 2020 (Docket No. AA-ENF-2020-69). The terminated order addressed unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to board and management supervision, internal audit, credit administration, and consumer compliance management, and for unsafe or unsound practices and violations of law related to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bank Secrecy Act\/anti-money laundering compliance program. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-47) Order Terminating the Cease and Desist Order against Vast Bank, N.A., Tulsa, Oklahoma, dated October 23, 2023 (Docket No. AA-SO-2023-44).

Removal of reputation risk references is identified by a strikethrough. Refer to OCC Bulletin 2025-4. Summary The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is issuing this bulletin to inform national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies (collectively, banks) of sound fraud risk management principles. This bulletin supplements other OCC and interagency issuances on corporate and risk governance, including the references listed in appendix A of this bulletin. Note for Community Banks This guidance applies to all OCC-supervised banks. Highlights The risk management principles addressed in this bulletin include the following: A bank should have sound corporate governance practices that instill a corporate culture of ethical standards and promote employee accountability. A bank's risk management system should include policies, processes, personnel, and control systems to effectively identify, measure, monitor, and control fraud risk consistent with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile. A bank's risk management system and system of internal controls should be designed to prevent and detect fraud. appropriately respond to fraud, suspected fraud, or allegations of fraud. Bank management should assess the likelihood and impact of potential fraud schemes and use the results of this assessment to inform the design of the bank's risk management system. Senior management and the board of directors should measure, monitor, and understand fraud losses across the enterprise and employ tools that appropriately quantify and assess loss experience and exposure. Control reviews and audits should include fraud risk as part of their assessments. Fraud risk management principles can be implemented in a variety of ways and may not always be structured within a formal fraud risk management program. Regardless of the structure, fraud risk management should be commensurate with the bank's risk profile. Banks with significant and far-reaching retail-oriented business activities should have well-documented fraud risk management programs with appropriate monitoring, measurements and reporting, and mitigation. Background Fraud may generally be characterized as an intentional act, misstatement, or omission designed to deceive others, resulting in the victim suffering a loss or the perpetrator achieving a gain.1 Fraud is typically categorized as internal or external. Internal fraud occurs when a director, an employee, a former employee, or a third party engaged by the bank commits fraud, colludes to commit fraud, or otherwise enables or contributes to fraud. External fraud consists of first-party fraud and victim fraud. External fraud is committed by a person or entity that is not a bank employee, a former employee, or a third party engaged by the bank. First-party fraud occurs when an external party, including a bank customer, commits fraud against the bank. Victim fraud occurs when a bank customer or client is the victim of an intentional fraudulent act. Fraud schemes are often ongoing crimes that can go undetected for months or even years and can be time consuming and costly to address. It is often difficult to fully understand and quantify the extent of the fraud and the harm caused. Measuring losses associated with fraud is often an inexact process. Typically, the true cost of fraud is greater than the direct financial loss, given the time and expense to investigate, loss of productivity, potential legal and compliance costs associated with remediation, and impact on a bank's reputation. Fraud risk is a form of operational risk, which is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events.2 Operational risk management weaknesses can result in heightened exposure to fraudulent activities, which can increase a bank's exposure to reputation and strategic risks. Failure to maintain an appropriate risk management system could expose the bank to the risk of significant fraud, defalcation (e.g., misappropriation of funds by an employee), and other operational losses. Governance Strong governance is of paramount importance to controlling the bank's exposure to fraud, and a strong corporate culture against fraud is crucial regardless of a bank's size or complexity. The tone at the top sets the foundation on which the bank operates. The board and senior management have a responsibility to lead by example and demonstrate that the bank is serious about promoting ethical behavior to deter and prevent fraud. The board-adopted code of ethics (or code of conduct) should encourage the timely communication and escalation of suspected fraud through the appropriate oversight channel. The board is ultimately responsible for oversight but may delegate fraud risk management-related duties to specific committees (for example, the audit committee or operational risk management committee). The board also may delegate anti-fraud responsibilities to specific executives and managers, including those in charge of managing risks and controls. Roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined. The board should hold management accountable for effective fraud risk management and alignment of anti-fraud efforts with the bank's strategy, objectives, risk appetite, and operational plans. While not all fraud can be avoided, an active board can foster an environment in which fraud is more likely to be prevented, deterred, and promptly detected. A sound corporate culture should discourage imprudent risk-taking. Incentives or requirements for employees to meet sales goals, financial performance goals, and other business goals, particularly if such goals are aggressive, can result in heightened fraud risk.3 Risk Management Sound fraud risk management principles should be integrated within the bank's risk management system commensurate with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile. Bank management should periodically assess the likelihood and impact of potential fraud schemes and use the documented results of this assessment to inform the design of the bank's risk management system and evaluate fraud control activities. Policies should clearly define, establish, and communicate the board's and senior management's commitment to fraud risk management. Processes should be designed to anticipate fraud and deploy a combination of preventive controls and detective controls. Detective controls are important because even with strong governance and oversight, collusion or circumvention of internal controls can allow fraud to occur. Some practices and controls may be both preventive and detective in nature. Preventive controls are designed to deter fraud or minimize its likelihood. The following are some examples: Policies and processes (e.g., ethics policies, code of conduct, identity theft program,4 and elder abuse policies) Anti-fraud awareness campaigns for board, senior management, staff, and third parties Fraud risk management training for employees and contractors commensurate with roles and responsibilities Customer education on fraud risks and preventive measures customers can take to reduce the risk of becoming victims System controls designed to prevent employees, agents, third parties, and others from conducting fraudulent transactions, performing inappropriate manual overrides, or manipulating financial reporting Controls to prevent fraudulent account opening, closing, or transactions Dual controls (e.g., over monetary instruments, accounting, customer transactions, and reporting) Segregation of duties Background investigations for new employees and periodic checks for existing employees and third parties Training customer-facing employees to identify potential victim fraud Sound information security programs5 Job breaks, such as mandatory consecutive two-week vacations or rotation of duties Customer identification program procedures, customer due diligence processes, and beneficial ownership identification and verification6 Real-time transaction analysis and behavioral analytics Detective controls are designed to identify and respond to fraud after it has occurred. The following are some examples: Models, monitoring systems, or reports designed to detect fraudulent activity across all lines of business and functions (e.g., exception reports, unusual card activity, unauthorized transactions, file maintenance reports, fee waiver analysis, and employee surveillance processes [account monitoring, system access patterns, and overrides]) Data analytics (e.g., loss data analysis, transactions, fee waivers, interest forgiven, charge-offs, errors, and consumer complaint data) Effective complaint resolution processes7 Monitoring and analysis of civil and criminal subpoenas received by the bank or information requests under section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act8 Monitoring and analysis of Bank Secrecy Act report filings by the bank and its affiliates Monitoring of news and other information concerning civil and criminal lawsuits Ethics and whistleblower reporting channels or hotlines Exit interviews for departing employees Software and technology tools, developed internally or purchased from a third party, can assist with anti-fraud efforts. Bank management should consider the cost and value of fraud prevention tools selected, consistent with the bank's overall strategy, complexity, and risk profile. Depending on the specific products and services offered, management might deploy solutions that serve to detect anomalies and prevent potential fraudulent transactions or activities. These solutions can monitor transactions and behaviors, employ layered or multifactor authentication, monitor networks for intrusions or malware, analyze transactions on internal bank platforms, and compare data with consortium or publicly available data. Banks' fraud prevention and detection tools should evolve and adapt to remain effective against emerging fraud types. Fraud Risk Measurement and Monitoring Senior management should understand the bank's exposure to fraud risk and associated losses across all business lines and functions and use this information to effectively monitor and manage fraud risk. The board should receive regular reporting on the bank's fraud risk assessment, resulting exposure to fraud risk, and associated losses to enable directors to understand the bank's fraud risk profile. Reporting should allow management and directors to measure performance. Practices can include benchmarking current fraud losses against loss history or industry data. Examples of metrics and analysis banks can use to measure and monitor fraud risk include the following: Metrics by fraud type (e.g., internal, external, loan, card, account opening, check, or embezzlement) Fraud losses (e.g., per open account, closed account, or litigation) Fraud recoveries Net fraud losses Fraud loss budget variance Automated clearing house return rates Percentage of customers claiming victim fraud Fraud control performance and control testing results Trend analysis of data such as number and dollar of fraud investigations customer complaints Bank Secrecy Act report metrics (e.g., Suspicious Activity Report [SAR] filings) civil and criminal subpoenas information requests under section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act Management should identify fraud losses as internal or external. Larger, more complex banks generally maintain this information in an operational loss database or similar system.9 Fraud Response, Reporting, and Information Sharing A bank's policies, processes, and control systems should prompt appropriate and timely investigations into, responses to, and reporting of suspected and confirmed fraud. Banks should have processes for internal investigations, law enforcement referrals, regulatory notifications,10 and reporting. A bank is required to file a SAR for known or suspected fraud meeting regulatory thresholds.11 Reporting mechanisms should relay relevant, accurate, and timely fraud-related information from all lines of business to appropriate oversight channels. Sound fraud risk management processes can include voluntary sharing of information with other financial institutions under section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act. Pursuant to section 314(b), before exchanging information, the bank must register with the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Current section 314(b) participants may share information with one another regarding individuals, entities, organizations, and countries for purposes of identifying and, when appropriate, reporting activities that may involve possible specified unlawful activities. FinCEN has issued guidance clarifying that, if section 314(b) participants suspect that transactions may involve the proceeds of specified unlawful activities, such as fraud, under the money laundering statutes,12 information related to such transactions can be shared under the protection of the section 314(b) safe harbor.13 Reviews and Audits A bank should design and perform reviews and audits specific to the bank's size, complexity, organizational structure, and risk profile. Reviews and audits should be designed to assess the effectiveness of the bank's internal controls and fraud risk management. Effective internal and external audit programs are a critical defense against fraud and provide vital information to the board of directors about the effectiveness of internal control systems. Reviews and audits typically include the following:14 Quality assurance and quality control reviews Independent risk management reviews Internal and external audits Retrospective reviews after fraud is identified Third-party relationship audits (or audit reports) consistent with contractual provisions When auditing financial statements and asserting effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, auditors must consider a material misstatement due to fraud.15 If the auditor identifies that fraud may be present, the auditor must discuss these findings with the board or management in a timely fashion.16 The auditor must also determine whether they have a responsibility to report the suspected fraud to the OCC.17 Findings and results from audits and reviews should be communicated to the relevant parties in a timely manner. Management should take timely and effective corrective action in response to deficiencies identified. Further Information Please contact Tanya A.

This bulletin does not address other risks, such as interest rate risk.2 Recission This bulletin rescinds Banking Bulletin 1993-50, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLoan Refinancing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Note for Community Banks This bulletin applies to all banks with commercial loans. Highlights This bulletin discusses the effect of refinance risk on credit risk in commercial loan transactions and portfolios. provides guidance on transaction and portfolio-level refinance risk management. Background Refinance risk is the risk that borrowers will not be able to replace existing debt at a future date under reasonable terms and prevailing market conditions. Refinance risk increases in rising interest rate environments and can be amplified by large volumes of loans set to mature in underperforming markets.3 If a borrower cannot refinance under current market conditions, a bank could be burdened with an underperforming or nonperforming loan. Refinance risk primarily affects loans with principal balances remaining at maturity and borrowers who rely on recurring debt to finance their capital structure or business operations. Examples of loan types most affected by refinance risk include interest-only loans, commercial real estate loans,4 leveraged loans, and revolving working capital lines. Fully amortizing loans to sound borrowers generally have lower refinance risk than loans that are not fully amortizing. Refinance risk affects individual loans and portfolios of loans. A concentration in such loans could increase the cost and complexity of problem loan resolutions when borrowers are under stress. In addition, if a significant volume or amount of loans refinance during adverse economic conditions, it could constrain a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital or liquidity, threaten earnings, or hinder strategic initiatives.5 Refinance risk can be driven by external factors or borrower-specific factors. External factors that affect refinance risk include investor risk appetite and market liquidity; the current interest rate environment; inflation; or supply chain effects on the costs of goods, services, or labor. Refinance risk increases in rising interest rate environments because borrowers may be unable to service their debt at higher interest rates upon refinance. Refinance risk may also increase for some borrowers or portfolios because of declining industry fundamentals or changes in commodity prices. Borrower-specific drivers for heightened refinance risk include high leverage, constrained liquidity, a significant volume of near-term maturities, poor financial performance, or unpopular market sentiment. Guidance Banks should have processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control refinance risk at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The tools to monitor refinance risk should be tailored to the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size, complexity, risk profile, and types of lending. Sound transaction-level credit risk management practices include assessing refinance risk at underwriting, during ongoing monitoring, and near maturity. At the portfolio level, banks should have systems and processes to monitor the volume and cadence of upcoming loan maturities. Independent credit risk review should consider the level of refinance risk when determining an appropriate review scope and assessing credit quality.6 One common method to assess refinance risk at the transaction and portfolio level is multivariable stress testing. Transaction-level stress testing can provide insight into the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to meet refinancing requirements if the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial condition declines or market conditions deteriorate (e.g., interest rates increase, market terms tighten, expenses increase, or collateral values fall). Portfolio-level stress testing can identify and measure the potential effect of changing market conditions on portfolio segments with higher refinance risk.7 Transaction-Level Risk Management and Risk-Rating Considerations Banks should evaluate refinance risk when approving and structuring loans, during ongoing monitoring (e.g., annual reviews), near loan maturity, and when considering granting extensions or renewals. Refinance risk can also be a factor when risk-rating a loan. A prudent assessment of refinance risk includes a borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refinancing needs, the performance of the underlying project or asset, the timing of a refinancing transaction (e.g., maturity), the amount and maturity dates of other debt, current market liquidity, and the cost of refinancing. At origination, banks can structure a loan to mitigate refinance risk. For example, underwriting standards may include debt service coverage or loan-to-value requirements that provide a cushion if a borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial condition declines or market conditions deteriorate. Banks may also require covenants that preserve the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to refinance (e.g., leverage covenants or limits on incremental debt) or trigger action before maturity to protect the bank (e.g., debt service coverage ratios or liquidity ratios). During ongoing monitoring and near maturity, management should conduct analysis to determine the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refinance requirements and ability to reasonably qualify for another market rate loan to cover the projected outstanding principal. The analysis can also provide insight into the likelihood that a borrower might seek refinancing prior to maturity (e.g., to support significant business expansion, because of a leveraged buyout, or to pay out a retiring partner). Effective analysis of refinance risk includes a loan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance compared with expectations at underwriting, the time horizon for a refinance event, borrower-specific factors, and external factors. Analysis should include determining whether a borrower can meet current underwriting standards, including prevailing interest rates, for similar loans. Banks should have refinance plans in place for borrowers with near-term refinancing needs. While market demand could affect a borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to refinance, generally the stronger a borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underlying financial performance, the more refinance options are available. For loans maturing with an outstanding principal balance or otherwise likely to require near-term refinancing, credit risk ratings should take into account the likelihood that the borrower will be able to obtain refinancing without relying on distressed terms. Refinance risk is just one consideration in determining an appropriate risk rating and should be evaluated in the context of the borrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall financial condition and debt service ability. While increased refinance risk does not automatically warrant a change in a loan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk rating, classification is appropriate when there are well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize repayment. Loans that are adequately protected by the current sound worth and debt service ability of the borrower, guarantor, or the underlying collateral8 generally are not adversely classified.9 Similarly, loans to sound borrowers that are modified in accordance with prudent underwriting standards are generally not adversely classified unless well-defined weaknesses exist that jeopardize repayment. Such loans, however, could be flagged for management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention or for inclusion in designated \u00e2\u0080\u009cwatch lists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Portfolio-Level Analysis and Risk Management Banks should have processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control refinance risk at the portfolio level. Assessing refinance risk at the portfolio level allows a bank to identify borrowers experiencing similar stresses, whether macroeconomic or specific to an industry or region. Effective processes generally include the ability to identify and monitor the volume and amount of loans maturing with outstanding principal balances and portfolio segments affected by external risk factors. stress-testing to identify portfolios with heightened refinance risk. limits that reflect the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk appetite. reporting that monitors the level of refinance risk and performance relative to established limits. A bank can mitigate refinance risk by establishing criteria that define when it is appropriate to underwrite loans that will not fully amortize by maturity (e.g., interest-only loans, loans with balloon payments, or revolving loans) and prudent terms for such loans (e.g., re-margining requirements, covenants, or cleanup requirements). Underwriting criteria can also detail the prudent use of interest rate swaps and caps. Banks can further mitigate refinance risk by setting appropriate underwriting exception limits, controls, and reporting (e.g., limiting loans underwritten with covenant-lite structures or with marginal debt service coverage or loan-to-value ratios). Setting and adhering to concentration limits can protect the balance sheet from potential refinancing shocks and bank capital from outsized losses when refinance options are limited. Refinance risk can occur across different lending products, and it is prudent for management to consider whether refinance risk creates correlated exposures not otherwise identified, especially during a deteriorating economic environment.10 Loans Restructured Under a Prudent Loan Workout Plan The OCC encourages banks to work proactively and prudently with borrowers who are, or may be, unable to meet their contractual payment obligations during periods of financial stress. An effective loan workout arrangement should improve the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prospects for repayment of principal and interest, be consistent with sound banking and accounting practices, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.11 Management should consider refinance risk when developing an effective workout strategy. In some cases, as part of a prudent workout plan, a loan originally underwritten with fully amortizing terms is restructured with an outstanding principal payment at maturity. Management should appropriately risk-rate and manage such loans. Management should also measure and monitor the volume of modified and restructured loans. When assessing refinance risk at the portfolio level, management should consider the volume of modified or restructured loans that will no longer fully amortize by maturity. If management determines that a loan refinance represents a modification or accommodation to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty,12 management should perform further analysis to determine whether the loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans and should be reviewed individually when determining an appropriate allowance for credit loss. Management should also determine whether the loan is collateral-dependent.13 Further Information Please contact Barry Mills, Director for Commercial Credit Risk Policy, at (202) 649-6220. Grovetta N.

For more information specific to commercial real estate lending, refer to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCommercial Real Estate Lending\u00e2\u0080\u009d booklet of the Comptroller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Handbook. 5 Refinance risk can affect a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest rate risk when a material amount of loans on the balance sheet with higher levels of refinance risk mature at the same time or within a tight time frame. Loans that are unable to refinance at market terms could result in an unplanned asset\/liability price mismatch on a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance sheet. 6 For more information about credit risk review, refer to OCC Bulletin 2020-50, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCredit Risk: Interagency Guidance on Credit Risk Review Systems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d 7 For more information on stress testing, refer to OCC Bulletin 2012-33, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCommunity Bank Stress Testing: Supervisory Guidance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and OCC Bulletin 2012-14, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStress Testing: Interagency Stress Testing Guidance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d 8 Collateral value alone is not sufficient to preclude adverse classification when well-defined weaknesses are present. Loans that rely on cash flow generating collateral as the primary source of repayment would need to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the debt under reasonable terms. 9 For more information on risk ratings, refer to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cRating Credit Risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d booklet of the Comptroller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Handbook. 10 For more information on concentration risk, refer to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cConcentrations of Credit\u00e2\u0080\u009d booklet of the Comptroller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Handbook. 11 For more information on prudent loan workouts for commercial real estate loans, refer to OCC Bulletin 2023-23, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCredit Administration: Final Interagency Policy Statement on Prudent Commercial Real Estate Loan Accommodations and Workouts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d 12 Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty should be reported in accordance with call report instructions. 13 For more information, refer to OCC Bulletin 2023-11, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCurrent Expected Credit Losses: Interagency Policy Statement on Allowances for Credit Losses (Revised April 2023).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Topic(s): Commercial Credit Credit Underwriting Our websites BankNet.gov Find resources for bankers.
